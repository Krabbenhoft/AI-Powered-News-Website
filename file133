   growing and the largest manufacturer of EVs is China's BYD. Their
   global revenue was over $100 billion in 2024, beating Tesla. To keep up
   that growth and to try to stave off the pain of U.S. tariffs, BYD is
   expanding in emerging markets. One of the markets where their cars are
   selling big is Brazil, where BYD is investing nearly a billion dollars
   in a factory. But as our Brazil correspondent tells us there have been
   some difficulties along the way.
