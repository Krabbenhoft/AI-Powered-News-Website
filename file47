   Our pets — whether dogs, cats, birds, reptiles, or any other animal —
   enrich our lives and fill our homes with love. Millions of animals are
   waiting in one of the many shelters in the U.S. for the opportunity to
   go to a fur-ever home. This is why [75]National Adopt a Shelter Pet
   Day, on April 30, exists to help bring awareness and help them get
   adopted. To celebrate, NPR wants to know how your pet changed your
   life. Your story could help influence someone to take the next step in
   their pet adoption journey.

   If you have a shelter pet that has impacted your life, please share
   your story with us via the form below. You could be featured in the Up
   First newsletter on April 27. You can also share a photo and upload
   your answers as a voice memo. Please submit responses by April 9.
