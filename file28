   The National Weather Service (NWS) is warning of "potentially historic"
   rainfall sweeping across the American South and Midwest through the
   weekend. This intense weather pattern has already resulted in several
   deaths and continues to pose a significant risk to the lives and
   livelihoods of millions of people in the region.

   Reports about the number of fatalities have varied but at least seven
   people have died in Tennessee, Missouri and Indiana due to these
   violent storms, [63]according to The Associated Press.

   "This flooding event will be a marathon — not a sprint," the NWS said
   in a [64]statement on X, warning the public about the storms. "Any
   flash and riverine flooding across these areas will have the potential
   to become catastrophic and life-threatening."

   The NWS warned of potentially devastating rainstorms expected from
   Thursday through early Sunday morning, affecting areas as far southwest
   as Dallas, and as far east as West Virginia.

     ⚠️This flooding event will be a marathon - not a sprint. Potentially
     historic rainfall is expected through this weekend from the Ozarks
     into the Mid-South, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Lower Ohio
     Valley. Any flash and riverine flooding across these areas will have
     the potential… [65]pic.twitter.com/xPODCHaeoX

   In addition, warnings [67]have been issued for tornadoes and flash
   flooding. By late Wednesday, Arkansas and Oklahoma had reported
   twisters, and windstorms were reported in Indiana and Kentucky on
   Thursday as well.

   Southwestern Kentucky into western Tennessee and northeastern Arkansas
   are at the highest risk of "life-threatening flash flooding," [68]the
   NWS said, in the wake of heavy rainfall on Wednesday.

Here are the latest updates from across the region

   In Tennessee, [69]NPR member station WPLN is covering the devastation
   caused by the storm across the state, which remains in a state of
   emergency.

   In Kentucky, businesses and residents have suffered property damage and
   personal injuries, [70]according to reporting by WUKY, and they are
   bracing for continued battering as the weather system moves through the
   weekend.

   [71]Little Rock Public Radio in Arkansas reports that much of the state
   is under threat, including risks from "baseball-sized hail" and
   high-speed tornadoes, with the northeastern quarter of the state facing
   the greatest danger.
