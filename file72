[124]It's time to rewrite the "trauma plot"

   [125]March 26, 2025  There are a lot of big subjects that our culture
   has trouble talking about: wealth, death, addiction, religion. But one
   of the toughest has to be sexual assault and rape. For how common
   sexual violence is – it affects over half of women and almost one in
   three men – it can be extremely painful and even stigmatizing to
   discuss. But in Jamie Hood's new book Trauma Plot, which contextualizes
   rape in her own life and in our culture, Jamie looks for new ways to
   speak the "unspeakable." It tells her story in experimental fragments
   and finds a unique way to discuss one of the most common violences we
   face. Brittany sits down with Jamie to discuss Trauma Plot, the
   contours of rape narratives in our culture, and how we can move beyond
   them to tell stories about sexual violence in new ways.
