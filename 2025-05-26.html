<h1>May 26, 2025: AI Boom Fuels Nvidia's Rise, Trump's Tariff Policy Impacts Markets, and Memorial Day Closure</h1>

<p><b>Nvidia's AI-Fueled Rise</b></p>
<p>The surge in artificial intelligence, catalyzed by the launch of ChatGPT, has dramatically propelled Nvidia's stock. Since ChatGPT's arrival roughly two and a half years ago, Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed by almost 700%, vastly exceeding the S&P 500's approximately 45% increase during the same period. This staggering growth cements Nvidia's position as a pivotal provider of chips essential for AI systems.</p>

<p>Nvidia's market capitalization has expanded substantially, far outpacing its competitors. While its market cap was already significant when ChatGPT was first released, it has since increased to command a substantially larger portion of the market. Meanwhile, rival Intel's growth has been comparatively modest, reflecting Nvidia's dominant position in the rapidly expanding AI sector.</p>

<p>Nvidia, along with other dominant tech companies, now accounts for a significantly larger percentage of the S&P 500's market cap than before the AI boom, highlighting the increasing concentration of market power within a few key players. This increased weighting has made overall market performance more sensitive to swings in Nvidia's stock price. The company's financial performance has bolstered investor confidence, with data center revenue – primarily from AI chip sales – experiencing explosive growth, particularly when measured against its peers in the industry.</p>

<p><b>Trump's Tariff Policy</b></p>
<p>Former President Trump has initiated a pause on tariffs, specifically an extension on EU tariffs, influencing market sentiment. However, it is essential to note that the underlying risk of a trade war remains. The market implications are considerable, with Wall Street showing signs of potential recovery following Trump's decision to delay these tariffs. This decision immediately impacted stock futures. The constant changes in tariff policy are contributing to market volatility and impacting investment strategies.</p>
<p>President Trump is also threatening increased tariffs on Apple as well as other tech companies such as Samsung.</p>

<p><b>Memorial Day Market Closure</b></p>
<p>U.S. stock markets are closed today, Monday, May 26, 2025, in observance of Memorial Day. This federal holiday, designated by the Financial Markets Association, is a solemn occasion to honor the deceased members of the U.S. military. Trading will resume as usual on Tuesday, following the holiday weekend. The next scheduled market closure is on Thursday, June 19, for Juneteenth.</p>
