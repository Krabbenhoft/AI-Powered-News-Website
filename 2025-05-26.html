<h1>May 26, 2025: AI Boom Continues, Tariff Tensions Fluctuate, and Memorial Day Observance</h1>

<p>Today's news highlights ongoing trends in the technology sector, fluctuating trade relations, and the observance of Memorial Day in the United States.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's Dominance in the AI Sector</h2>

<p>The AI sector continues to be a major driver of market activity. Nvidia, in particular, remains a central figure. Since the emergence of ChatGPT, the company's shares have risen dramatically, by nearly 700%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's growth of roughly 45% during the same period. This surge is primarily attributed to Nvidia's key role in providing the chips necessary for operating AI systems, positioning it at the heart of the AI arms race. This impressive growth is highlighted by significant increases in its market capitalization compared to its peers.  While Nvidia's market cap soared to over $3 trillion, Intel's only modestly grew.  This has led to a significant rise in the combined market capitalization of the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies (which includes Nvidia).  These companies have grown from about 22% of the S&P 500's market cap to 32% today.  A large proportion of Nvidia's growth has been its data center revenue, including the sales of its AI chips. From the fourth quarter of 2023 to the final quarter of its 2025 reporting period, data center revenue grew almost 900%.</p>

<h2>Trade Tensions and Tariff Developments</h2>

<p>Trade tensions remain a significant factor influencing global markets. While President Trump has paused the implementation of new tariffs on the European Union after "good calls" with EU negotiators, the underlying risk of a trade war persists.  Earlier in the week, Trump even threatened large tariffs on Apple, opening another front in the trade tensions. This volatility has caused concern among investors and has contributed to fluctuations in the stock market.  The initial threat of tariffs led to stocks stumbling last week. This pause offers a temporary reprieve, but the potential for renewed trade disputes continues to cast a shadow over the economic outlook.</p>

<h2>Memorial Day Observance</h2>

<p>Today, May 26, 2025, marks Memorial Day in the United States. In observance of this holiday, U.S. stock markets are closed. Memorial Day is a day to honor and mourn service members who have died while serving in the U.S. military. As such, no trading activity is scheduled for today. Regular business on Wall Street is set to resume until the next scheduled closure on Thursday, June 19, for Juneteenth.</p>
