<h1>May 26, 2025: AI Boom Continues, Trump's Tariff Threat, and Memorial Day Market Closure</h1>

<p>Today's news landscape is dominated by the continuing rise of artificial intelligence, trade tensions stoked by former President Trump, and the closure of US markets in observance of Memorial Day.</p>

<h2>Nvidia's AI Dominance</h2>

<p>Nvidia, a semiconductor company, has become the undisputed leader in the AI chip market. Since the advent of ChatGPT and the widespread adoption of AI technologies, Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed, seeing nearly a 700% increase. This monumental growth significantly outpaces the S&P 500's relatively smaller 45% rise in the same period. Its position is central to the AI "arms race".</p>

<p>The increase in Nvidia's market capitalization to over $1 trillion highlights its pivotal role. For context, rival Intel's market cap also rose, but only by $47 billion to $177 billion.  This emphasizes Nvidia's staggering performance within the semiconductor industry. Nvidia’s data center revenue, which includes AI chip sales, has increased by an astonishing 900% from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the final quarter of its 2025 reporting period.</p>

<p>Nvidia's outsized weighting within the S&P 500 means that its stock performance has a direct impact on broad market investors.  Several Wall Street strategists have updated their S&P 500 targets upward, citing the impressive performance of key AI companies such as Nvidia. This growth comes from consistent financial metrics and not just hype. </p>

<p>The "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, including Nvidia, have seen their combined market capitalization increase from just under $8 trillion at the start of the AI boom to now accounting for about 32% of the S&P 500's market cap, up from about 22% in November 2022.</p>

<h2>Trump's Tariff Threats and Trade War Concerns</h2>

<p>Former President Donald Trump's stance on international trade is once again causing market jitters. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on Apple products, suggesting that Samsung and other tech companies could be next. Additionally, concerns are present due to his threatening to more than double the size of the 20% initial “reciprocal” tariff on the EU. </p>

<p>The potential trade war that could be ignited is causing concern for experts that it will shake stocks' rally as investors brace for a long, hot summer. Trump also said that he’s ‘not looking for a deal’ with the EU after threatening a 50% tariff, implying that tariffs may be here to stay.</p>

<h2>Memorial Day Market Closure</h2>

<p>U.S. stock markets are closed today, Monday, May 26, 2025, in observance of Memorial Day. This federal holiday, observed the last Monday of May, honors and mourns military personnel who have died in the performance of their military duties for the United States.</p>

<p>Trading will resume as usual on Tuesday, May 27th. The next scheduled market closure is on Thursday, June 19th, for Juneteenth.</p>
