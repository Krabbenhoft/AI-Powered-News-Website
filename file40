   The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says it will end a mortgage
   rescue plan that has saved nearly 20,000 veterans from needlessly
   losing their homes.

   The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs said Thursday that it will end
   a mortgage-rescue program designed to help veterans who have fallen
   behind on their mortgages keep their homes.

   But the scant details offered so far by the VA make it unclear whether
   the program will be replaced by a different rescue program — or whether
   the move will strand thousands of other vets, many of whom are in
   financial peril because of the VA's own mistakes.

   Tens of thousands of veterans were left facing foreclosure after the VA
   abruptly cancelled a key part of a pandemic-era mortgage relief program
   that allowed vets to skip mortgage payments if they had trouble paying.
   When NPR [67]first uncovered the VA's move in late 2023, there were
   about 40,000 vets in danger of losing their homes.

   The VA responded by [68]halting foreclosures for a full year while it
   rolled out a rescue plan. That rescue plan, called VASP, has now put
   17,109 veterans and their families into new, low-interest-rate,
   affordable mortgages, according to the VA.

   In a statement to NPR Thursday, the VA said it was ending the VASP
   program. "Beginning May 1, 2025, VA's Veterans Affairs Servicing
   Purchase Program [VASP]... will stop accepting new enrollees," it said.
   "This change is necessary because VA is not set up or intended to be a
   mortgage loan restructuring service."

[71]A VA rescue effort saved 15,000 veterans' homes. Some in Congress want to
scrap it

   Republican critics in Congress don't like that VASP buys the rescued
   loans from the mortgage industry, and then holds the loans on the VA's
   own books. They say that puts too much taxpayer money at risk.

   "The Trump administration rightfully put an end to VA's VASP program,"
   said a joint press release Thursday from U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, an
   Illinois Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Veterans'
   Affairs, and U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican.

   Veterans groups, housing advocates, and mortgage company executives all
   say they believe that ending VASP without replacing it with another
   affordable option for veterans who have fallen behind on their loan
   payments could result in unnecessary foreclosures.

   At a recent hearing before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, a
   representative of a trade group that works to advance the interests of
   real estate lenders said that would be a disaster.

    "Without VASP, VA would have foreclosed on tens of thousands of
   borrowers," said Elizabeth Balce, representing the Mortgage Bankers
   Association.

   Balce said scuttling the VASP program, especially before VA stands up
   an alternative, would have one clear result.

   "Foreclosure. Period," she said, "That's really where it's gonna come
   to. The short answer is foreclosure."

   For thousands of veterans, it's [72]not their fault that they're in
   this predicament. The vets had reached out to their mortgage companies
   during a time of financial hardship and were told that by taking
   advantage of the VA's mortgage forbearance program they could skip some
   mortgage payments and have an affordable way to get current on their
   mortgages again.

   After mortgage rates spiked from around 3 percent to 7 percent in 2022,
   however, the only affordable way for these vets to do that was through
   what's called a "partial claim" that allowed the vets to move the
   missed payments to the back of their loan term, and then just resume
   paying their mortgage. But in October of 2022, the VA suddenly pulled
   the plug on that partial claim program, stranding tens of thousands of
   vets with no affordable way to get current and start paying their loans
   again.

   The Republican critics of VASP have been pressuring the VA to restore
   the partial claim program because they prefer that option to VASP.

   "This action underscores House Republicans' intent to establish a
   partial claims program at VA to ensure veterans' can stay in their
   homes if they're in financial hardship," Van Orden and Bost said in
   their statement.

   But during the Biden administration, VA maintained that it lacked the
   authority to do that without an act of Congress, and it is unclear if
   or when Congress would pass legislation that Van Orden has introduced
   to that end.

   VA officials did not say Thursday whether the agency now plans to stand
   up a partial claim or some other option for veterans to replace VASP,
   or whether agency officials are worried that this move to end the
   program will result in thousands of veterans losing their homes.

   At the hearing last month, nonprofit consumer protection groups
   submitted [76]a letter to the House Veterans Affairs committee warning
   of unnecessary foreclosures if VASP were to be scrapped, but also
   supporting a new partial claim program at VA.

   Housing, industry, and veterans groups all say that if the VA ends its
   VASP program without first replacing it with another affordable option
   such as a partial claim, that will leave veterans with far worse
   options than most other American homeowners.

   Loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA all have low-interest
   rate loan modification or partial claim programs for homeowners, but VA
   will not once VASP ends. That's despite the fact that for generations
   VA home loans have been a path to the middle class for those who serve
   in the military.
