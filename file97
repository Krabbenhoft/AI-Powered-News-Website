   It's Friday, and instead of looking through your fingers at your 401k
   this morning, we recommend opening up your preferred music streaming
   app and losing yourself in the glorious new records released overnight.

   NPR Music's Stephen Thompson welcomed [81]Zach McCormick of Minnesota
   Public Radio's The Current to our weekly New Music Friday episode to
   discuss Twin Cities hometown hero Craig Finn, who released his sixth
   solo album, Always Been, today. Stephen and Zach also get into a "no
   skips" album from the band Momma and much more.

   Listen to the conversation below, and stream our recommended new
   albums.
