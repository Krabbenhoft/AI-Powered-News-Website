   Elizabeth Olsen wants her work to better reflect her taste Elizabeth
   Olsen doesn't want validation, but she does want you to understand her
   taste. She shares why she's terrified of dying, but is fascinated with
   death and the joy of idle people watching.

   Watch NPR's existential gameshow

Elizabeth Olsen is good at ignoring advice

   April 3, 20257:00 AM ET
   [63]Headshot of Rachel Martin

   [64]Rachel Martin

   A note from Wild Card host Rachel Martin: Being a supervillain is
   exhausting. You spend a lot of energy thinking about how to mess with
   your enemies. Using your actual superpowers is totally draining. And
   once you're in that supervillain box, it can be hard to escape. Unless
   you're Elizabeth Olsen. She first showed up in the Marvel Cinematic
   Universe about a decade ago as Wanda Maximoff. And by 2021, she was
   flying around wreaking havoc as the Scarlet Witch in WandaVision.

   And while Olsen hasn't closed the door on that character, we have
   definitely seen her talent unfold in some totally different directions
   over the last few years. I, for one, am sort of obsessed with her
   performance in the Netflix show [65]Love and Death from 2023. She plays
   a sweet and loving housewife who brutally murders her husband's lover.
   And when I watched how Elizabeth Olsen held all the contradictions of
   that character at the same time, I knew I was going to be seeing a lot
   more of her.

   Her newest film is called The Assessment, and in it, Elizabeth plays a
   woman in the not-so-distant future, living in some kind of protected
   society because the Earth has been destroyed, and she's got to pass
   this nightmare of a test in order to be granted the chance to have a
   baby.

   This Wild Card interview has been edited for length and clarity. Host
   Rachel Martin asks guests randomly-selected questions from a deck of
   cards. Tap play above to listen to the full podcast, or read an excerpt
   below.
     __________________________________________________________________

Question 1: What's something someone told you that changed your trajectory?

   Elizabeth Olsen: I didn't have any mentors growing up and I felt like I
   was very self-motivated and I didn't listen to a lot of people's
   opinions within my family, and I just kind of kept doing what I wanted
   to do.
   [66]Actor, writer and director Jesse Eisenberg says he has had far more
   failures than successes.

[67]Wild Card Video Episodes

[68]Jesse Eisenberg isn't ambitious — but he does worry about failing

   Rachel Martin: Did your parents try to nudge you away from acting? I
   mean, we have to just acknowledge your two older sisters were in Full
   House, Mary-Kate and Ashley. And so it's not like it was totally
   foreign to you, that world.

   Olsen: No, not at all. There's six of us in my dad's house and four in
   my mom's. And so you're just kind of on your own when you have that
   many kids in your family, which is why it's hard for me to think of
   something that really created a different trajectory. I mean, there are
   definitely "told you so moments" from other people who gave me advice.
   Like, there are definitely things that I could have learned from, but I
   needed to make the mistakes myself before taking advice blindly because
   I'm stubborn in ways and needed to figure it out.

   Martin: Is there an example that you'd be willing to share of a piece
   of advice that you did not take?

   Sponsor Message

   Olsen: Um, No. Because to tell you the truth, all the good advice that
   I did ignore and maybe would have benefited from came from my sisters
   and it always becomes such a bigger story when I introduce things that
   they told me.

   Martin: That's OK. I understand. It's a strange thing. To grow up in
   that dynamic with those particular siblings.

   Olsen: Especially because we do all live our lives in a very private
   way. And so when it's about my work and it pivots and I feel like I'm
   roping them into something they didn't sign up for is when I feel bad.
   [69]Kathryn Hahn says she has more control over her choices and is not
   as afraid to say what she wants.

[70]Culture

[71]'I have more say': Why Kathryn Hahn feels more powerful than ever

   Martin: Yeah, totally. I respect that. But it's nice to hear,
   obviously, as sisters do, they gave you advice and you could take it or
   not take it.

   Olsen: And I could have benefited from taking it.

Question 2: What is something you still feel you need to prove to the people
you meet?

   Olsen: My taste. I think I haven't always successfully made choices in
   my work that are aligned with my personal taste and that is something I
   feel like I'm still trying to prove when I meet people.

   Martin: Because you didn't really want to be a superhero?

   Olsen: I mean, I did, actually. When I started Marvel, I thought the
   movies were so, so great. I thought they were such great, Greek-type
   scale stories that reflected politics and culture in a really lovely
   way. And so I felt really proud to jump into it. And then, within the
   last 10 years, it's taken on this narrative of, it's like a hot take,
   whether an actor says they would never do a Marvel movie or not.

   Martin: But what is it about your taste that you feel insecure about?

   Olsen: I think that is why — because I've spent so many years doing
   Marvel that I feel like all my other jobs have to really reflect my
   personal taste because, as much as I love being a part of this world
   and I'm proud of what I've been able to do with the character, it's not
   really the art that I consume. Which I've been very honest about. And
   so, I feel like I have to really focus on what to couple all of those
   films and shows that I do with Marvel to showcase my taste.

Question 3: Do you think there's more to reality than we can see or feel?

   Olsen: My instinct is to say yes. I've recently become — not obsessed,
   but very interested in — trying to find language of non-tangible things
   that I believe are real. And I don't like the word "spirituality,"
   personally.

   Martin: How come?

   Olsen: I feel like there's a lot of, there's just a lot of connotations
   that I put onto it that have to do with sets of belief that I don't
   feel aligned to.

   Martin: Can you give me one example of a belief that you let go or
   something that doesn't sit with you within the construct of
   spirituality?

   Olsen: Like, moon circles? Like, when people celebrate the full moon. I
   don't actually believe in the power of these icons. Or organized
   religions, which I think are, you know, great for people.

   Martin: But neither feels like home to you — like moon ceremony or
   organized religion.

   Olsen: No. And yet the word that I have now adopted is "atemporal."
   Like, there's the temporal body and the atemporal body, which is the
   things we can't quantify, um, like you can't quantify love, um, you
   can't quantify creativity, but it exists as a part of a person.
