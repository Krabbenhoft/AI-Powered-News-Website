   The Pentagon acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins is beginning an
   evaluation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the Signal
   messaging app to discuss military operations.

   [63]Stebbins' memo on Thursday follows a request from the Republican
   chairman and the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee
   for a probe into the incident, which was first reported by the
   journalist Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. The lawmakers have voiced
   concern about whether Hegseth and other top national security officials
   shared classified information on a commercially available encrypted
   messaging app as they discussed a military strike against Houthi rebels
   in Yemen.

[66]Intelligence leaders: We didn't share classified information in Signal
chat group

   "If true, this reporting raises questions as to the use of unclassified
   networks to discuss sensitive and classified information, as well as
   the sharing of such information with those who do not have proper
   clearance and need to know," Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Sen. Jack
   Reed, D-R.I., [67]wrote to Stebbins.

   On Thursday, Reed said in a statement he welcomed the investigation,
   saying the White House and the defense secretary have "tried
   desperately to mislead the public about this blunder. I cannot
   overstate how serious of a failure it is."

   Stebbins wrote that the aim of his investigation "is to determine the
   extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel
   complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of a commercial
   messaging application for official business." The review will also
   examine "compliance with classification and records retention
   requirements," he said.

   Stebbins became acting inspector general after President Trump
   [68]fired a swath of inspectors general across the government after
   taking office in January.

   Hegseth has adamantly denied that any classified war plans were
   discussed in the Signal chat. Goldberg reported that Hegseth shared
   information about targets, weapons and attack sequencing just ahead of
   [69]the airstrikes, which Reed and others charge put U.S.
   servicemembers at risk.

[72]White House says it's 'case closed' on the Signal group chat review

   The White House said on Monday that it had [73]concluded its own review
   of how Goldberg was inadvertently included on the group chat, and said
   that none of the information shared was classified, despite its
   sensitive nature.

   "This case has been closed here at the White House as far as we are
   concerned," press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. "There
   have been steps made to ensure that something like that can obviously
   never happen again, and we're moving forward," she added, without
   detailing those steps.
