   [101]A boy jumps into the Chao Phraya river during a heatwave in
   Bangkok, Thailand, on February 22, 2024. This image recalls the free
   feeling of leaping from several times one’s height into water as a

   feat over and over again as your friends laugh and cheer you on. A time
   many of us might remember as one when we felt truly whole and at peace,
   even if life wasn’t perfect. It’s always worth realizing that this
   version of ourselves still exists somewhere inside, and to let that
   lend us a sense of well-being that can never be taken away.
