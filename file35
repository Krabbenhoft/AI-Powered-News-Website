   A computer game kid show, a gay rom-com and an anthology flick that
   combines so many other genres, it's fair to say that Hollywood has all
   its bases covered at the cineplex this weekend. Here are three of the
   buzziest movies on the way.

A Minecraft Movie

   In theaters Friday

   A Minecraft Movie is the first attempt to adapt the blockbuster video
   game Minecraft for the big screen. The film stars Jack Black and Jason
   Momoa in a goofy and sprawling adventure full of blocky animals and
   magical macguffins. Minecraft is the biggest-selling video game of all
   time, so it's only natural that it would spawn a film franchise. But
   the Minecraft universe in the games isn't really built on characters
   with discrete personalities — it's more of a sandbox-style
   world-building game, where you construct elaborate shelters that help
   protect you from marauding pig-warriors and zombies. Turning Minecraft
   into a movie presents a challenge, because the film has a lot of
   character development to catch up on. But, as The Lego Movie and Barbie
   have demonstrated, it's possible to get it spectacularly right.

   A Minecraft Movie stars Jack Black as Steve — he's the default
   blank-slate character in the Minecraft games. Here, he's an extremely
   eager adventurer who lives for the mines and is trying to protect a
   powerful cube that allows its holder to pass through different realms.
   An army of pigs wants to use the cube for the purposes of plundering,
   but their efforts are complicated when the cube — the movie has fun
   with the fact that everyone calls it an "orb" — falls into the hands of
   a washed-up gamer named Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison. He's played
   by Jason Momoa.

   Soon enough, Garrett, Steve, a pair of plucky orphans, and a realtor
   played by Danielle Brooks are venturing through different realms.
   Naturally, along the way, they unveil and deploy various Minecraft
   Easter eggs, and maybe even learn a little something about the value of
   creativity and friendship. — Stephen Thompson

Freaky Tales

   In theaters Friday

   IFRAME: [67]https://www.youtube.com/embed/-2e8SYmofZM?rel=0

   Before they directed Captain Marvel, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck made
   such indies as Half Nelson, Sugar and Mississippi Grind. But even their
   indie cred won't prepare you for this underdog grindhouse freak-out in
   four chapters. It's May 10, 1987 in the Bay Area, the night the Golden
   State Warriors outlasted the Lakers in a fourth quarter blaze of glory
   by point guard Eric "Sleepy" Floyd (played here by Jay Ellis). But
   Oakland's got a lot more going on that night: a music club brawl
   between freaks and neo-Nazis, a hip-hop battle between rapper Too Short
   and two disrespected women who mop up the floor with him, a crime-world
   debt collector (Pedro Pascal) who's got more to live for than he
   thought when he decided this was his last day on earth, and a foiled
   heist that will lead to some truly epic retribution.

   There's a lot going on in this anthology film. The directors find joy
   in moments that might otherwise read as brutal — a shy kid with a
   beautiful smile who discovers his grin's more seductive when a fight
   leaves him gap-toothed, the balletic grace of the final act's
   slice-and-dice fest; and some fabulously athletic breakdancing under
   the final credits. Real life Too Short and Sleepy Floyd put in brief
   appearances, as does a green glow that may or may not explain how these
   stories are all connected. — Bob Mondello

A Nice Indian Boy

   In limited theaters Friday

   IFRAME: [68]https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkbyxebDrjA?rel=0

   YouTube

   Also a story in chapters, this charmer of a rom-com starts at a big
   Indian American wedding where Naveen (Karan Soni, of Deadpool fame) is
   sitting alone, the gay son who never brings boyfriends home to meet the
   family. Not that he has a boyfriend, though that changes when he and
   Jay (Jonathan Groff, of Glee and Hamilton), meet cute. A handsome white
   photographer who was adopted by an Indian couple, Jay is arguably more
   culturally Indian than Naveen — they first lay eyes on each other in
   their local Hindu temple. But tell that to Naveen's folks, who are
   startled and then charmed when Jay calls them Auntie and Uncle and
   touches their feet as a sign of respect.

   By the time mom's planning a gay Indian wedding, it's hard to tell who
   the fish-out-of-water is in director [69]Roshan Sethi's sweetly corny
   adaptation of a stage play by Madhuri Shekar. The film doesn't look
   deeply at the traditions it's variously spoofing or employing, or the
   psychology of its characters, but it brings plenty of color, music and
   Bollywood flair to getting its two lovebirds to finally sing in
   harmony. — Bob Mondello
