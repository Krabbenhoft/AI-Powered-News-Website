[71]How the Education Department helps students with disabilities get an
education

   The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funds from
   public schools that have diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

   In[72] a letter to state leaders across the country, the U.S. Education
   Department said Title I funding, which is targeted to schools with a
   high proportion of low income students, would be threatened if schools
   failed to follow its interpretation of civil rights laws.

   Any violation of civil rights law, it says, "including the use of
   Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion ('DEI') programs to advantage one's race
   over another—is impermissible."

   School and state officials are required to sign a certification letter
   attached to the memo and return it to the department within 10 days,
   proving that they are complying with the directive.

   This is the latest in a series of letters the department has issued to
   state and local school leaders: one focused on student privacy, another
   abruptly ending COVID relief funding promised to schools, and another
   issuing guidance on how to use federal funds to support parent choice
   in public education.

   While Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has not clearly defined what
   the administration considers a violation of civil rights law, [73]the
   agency issued a letter in February that notified educational
   institutions that they must "cease using race preferences and
   stereotypes as a factor in their admissions, hiring, promotion,
   scholarship."

   In a related document addressing frequently asked questions about how
   the administration would interpret Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
   1964, the agency said: "Many schools have advanced discriminatory
   policies and practices under the banner of 'DEI' initiatives." The
   document went on to say that schools could engage in historical
   observances like Black History Month "so long as they do not engage in
   racial exclusion or discrimination."

   While the federal government is only responsible for about 10% of money
   that goes to schools, Title I is one of the largest federal grants
   overseen by the Education Department: In the current fiscal year, the
   federal government set aside more than $18.38 billion for Title I.
   Nearly 90% of U.S. school districts benefit from the program.

   "Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right," Craig
   Trainor, the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights,
   said in a statement. "When state education commissioners accept federal
   funds, they agree to abide by federal antidiscrimination requirements.
   Unfortunately, we have seen too many schools flout or outright violate
   these obligations, including by using DEI programs to discriminate
   against one group of Americans to favor another based on identity
   characteristics."

   Many educators worry that the removal of this money could have
   significant impacts, especially [74]to rural and low income communities
   that rely heavily on federal funding.

   The American Federation of Teachers, with 1.8 million members the
   nation's second largest teachers union, is [75]part of a lawsuit aimed
   at blocking the department's recent civil rights guidelines.

   "In the middle of a school year, the president is trying to bully the
   very same school districts that he insisted, just a few weeks ago,
   should be in charge of education," the AFT's president, Randi
   Weingarten said in a statement. "He's wielding a cudgel of billions in
   federal aid to tens of millions of children, of all races and
   ethnicities, to force educators to kowtow to his politics and
   ideology."

   In the rural Lucerne Valley Unified School District in the high desert
   of California, Superintendent Peter Livingston says he's still
   digesting the latest civil rights guidelines. He says about 90% of his
   district's students are considered economically disadvantaged, and all
   of its schools rely on Title I.

   "If the money were to be threatened, that would have a huge impact," he
   says.

   But he also favors the efforts to reduce the role of the Education
   Department in local schools, especially if it means federal dollars
   could be used more efficiently.

   He says his district uses Title I funds to hire staff, to keep class
   sizes smaller and for academic programs that help "level the playing
   field" for students regardless of their income.

   "If the regulations are in place that we have to follow," he adds,
   "that's what we'd be doing in order to ensure that we had the money to
   serve our students."
