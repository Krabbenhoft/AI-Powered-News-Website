   Free and independent journalism from your community, your country, your

   Rather than exploring what matters from the top down, the NPR Network
   gives everyone a voice. We’re a network of over 200 local newsrooms,
   bringing all Americans closer through journalism, music, politics, and
   culture. Our local-national-global blend fully immerses you in your
   world, so you can understand it better.

   Breaking News

   When major news breaks in a community, local Member station reporters
   can be the first on the scene.

   NPR listeners across the country heard Texas Public Radio’s Brian
   Kirkpatrick [10]describe the horrific scene at the Uvalde school where
   a shooter killed 19 children and two teachers. To deliver reliable
   information to Spanish speakers in the community over the following
   days, the station translated stories and posted them on its
   [11]Noticias web page.
   Expertise

   Whether it’s NPR’s Michele Kelemen at the State Department or Nashville
   Public Radio’s Blake Farmer on the health beat, NPR Network journalists
   bring deep knowledge and experience to help people make sense of their
   world.

   Education reporters from Member stations in Indiana and Oregon teamed
   up with NPR’s Ed Desk to explore age-appropriate, comprehensive [12]sex
   education in schools. And NPR’s Climate Desk reporter Rebecca Hersher
   explained the relationship between [13]hurricanes and climate change.

   Untold Stories

   From ambitious investigations to moments of joy, the NPR Network
   delivers stories you won’t find anywhere else. We share overlooked
   perspectives and lift up voices that must be heard.

   Extreme heat is claiming the lives of U.S. agriculture and construction
   workers with greater frequency. An [16]investigation by NPR and Member
   stations examined the lack of federal rules to protect them. And the
   Gulf States Newsroom probed the challenges Cameroonian [17]asylum
   seekers face in Louisiana and Mississippi.
   Cultural Discovery

   If you want to meet a first-time novelist, catch a new music artist or
   preview the best TV shows to stream, the NPR Network does that too. We
   serve up arts, entertainment, science, technology and more to keep you
   abreast of the nation’s zeitgeist.

   Our offerings include NPR’s legendary [18]Tiny Desk concerts, [19]Books
   We Love, [20]Code Switch conversations about race and the [21]Short
   Wave science podcast, along with [22]World Cafe from WXPN, [23]Fresh
   Air from WHYY and lots of [24]can’t-miss podcasts from across the NPR
   Network.
