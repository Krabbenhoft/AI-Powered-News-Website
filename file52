   Trump issues another TikTok ban extension On his first day in office,
   President Trump used an executive order to hit pause on the TikTok ban
   for 75 days. Now he's pushing back that deadline.

Trump extends TikTok's sell-by deadline again

   President Trump has again promised to delay enforcement of TikTok's
   sell-by date, extending the video app's effective deadline to sever
   ties with its China-based corporate owner by 75 days.

   The White House's TikTok deal "requires more work to ensure all
   necessary approvals are signed," Trump [64]wrote on Truth Social.

   He said the administration hopes to "continue working in Good Faith
   with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal
   Tariffs," referring to the 34 percent levy on Chinese imports Trump
   announced this week.

   "We do not want TikTok to "go dark." We look forward to working with
   TikTok and China to close the Deal," Trump wrote on his social media
   site.

   Negotiators had been expecting to announce a deal on Friday morning on
   TikTok, but one factor that complicated the plans was Trump's firing of
   a National Security Council official who was helping to coordinate the
   TikTok deal, according to a source directly involved in the talks who
   was not authorized to speak on the record.

   The Friday reprieve provides TikTok with a bit of breathing room in
   what has been a bumpy year. A [65]federal law took effect in January
   that legally banned the service nationwide unless it split away from
   ByteDance, the Beijing tech giant that owns the viral video app, which
   it did not.

   Congress passed the ban in 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support
   over national security fears that an app used by more than half of
   Americans should not be controlled by China, a foreign adversary of the
   U.S. TikTok fought the ban all the way to the Supreme Court, calling it
   a violation of free speech rights â€” but the high court [66]upheld the
   law in early 2025.

   Starting the evening of Jan. 18, just before the ban was planned to
   take effect, the [67]app went dark for 14 hours. But it flickered back
   on the next day after Trump promised to sign an order delaying
   enforcement of the ban once he was sworn into office.

   On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an [68]executive order effectively
   pushing back the start of the ban by 75 days, and promising immunity
   for other tech companies that provide back end services for the app,
   such as Apple and Google, which host it in their web stores. That
   extension was set to expire on April 5.

   The new order pushes it back by another 75 days.

   Legal experts say Trump's delays do not halt the TikTok ban, meaning it
   is still technically illegal for TikTok to operate in the U.S. with
   ties to China. Yet moves by Trump and his administration [69]assuring
   TikTok and its service providers that U.S. authorities will not
   prosecute anyone under the law have been enough for the popular app to
   stay online despite operating in violation of a federal statute.

   Since January, Trump has said there has been "tremendous interest" from
   potential buyers of TikTok, an app used by more than 170 million
   Americans and a remarkably valuable asset for anyone who might want to
   influence a whole generation of young internet users who flock to the
   service every day.

   NPR [70]reported in January that cloud computing company Oracle has
   been tapped by the White House as a top contender to lead a coalition
   of other investors to acquire a sizable stake in TikTok's U.S.
   operation.

   Oracle is run by Larry Ellison, a billionaire Republican donor who has
   long been a close ally of Trump.

   During Trump's first term, when he [71]attempted to ban TikTok, he
   selected Oracle to lead a [72]take over effort that collapsed in part
   because it could not win the support of regulators in China.

   Likewise, securing the approval of the Chinese government has been a
   key sticking point this time around, with [73]TikTok insiders telling
   NPR that any sale blessing from Beijing could hinge on China landing
   some kind of relief from tariffs.
