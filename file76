Our Mission

   The mission of NPR, in partnership with its member stations, is to
   create a more informed public, one challenged and invigorated by a
   deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and culture
   within the United States and across the globe. To this end, NPR
   reports, produces, acquires and distributes news, information and other
   content that meet the highest standards of public service in journalism
   and cultural expression.

Our Guiding Principles

   [Editor's Note: This section revised on July 7, 2021 to reflect the
   work and thinking of the Ethics Handbook Committee.]

   NPR is, at its core, a news organization. Our work, whether on the air
   online, through podcasts, video, or in any other form, aspires to the
   heights of public service. We take seriously our democratic role as
   watchdogs, holding the powerful accountable as we hold ourselves to the
   core principles of honesty, integrity, independence, accuracy,
   contextual truth, transparency, respect and fairness for the people we
   serve and the people we cover. We know that truth is not possible
   without the active pursuit of a diversity of voices, especially those
   most at risk of being left out.
   With these guiding principles in mind, this handbook is intended not as
   a prescriptive list of do's and don'ts. Rather, it is a foundation upon
   which staff should consider these often-competing principles and
   exercise judgment in deciding how to best represent the core values of
   our organization and to serve our audiences with journalism they can
   trust.

Who is covered

   [Editor's Note: This section was revised on July 7, 2021 to reflect the
   work and thinking of the Ethics Handbook Committee.]

   All editorial staff are bound by this guidance. Editorial staff are
   defined as staff members who play a role in shaping the journalistic or
   creative direction of NPR's content, including events.
   This includes, but is not limited to, leadership, managers, reporters,
   editors, newscasters, producers, visual journalists, data journalists,
   hosts and interns across the News and Programming divisions, as well as
   freelance editorial contributors and NPR events and promotions staff
   who shape editorially focused content. Contributors should adhere to
   the same standards, depending on what type of content creator they are.
   Non-editorial staff in the newsroom are not bound by this handbook and
   should follow the guidance of NPR's Code of Conduct. This includes
   administrative and support staff who do not have a role in content and
   coverage decisions, such as those in News Operations, News Application
   Development and Audio Engineering; Research, Archives and Data Strategy
   and NPR staff who only shape content for sponsors. The same holds for
   artists and graphic designers if they are not involved in making
   editorial decisions.
     __________________________________________________________________

[79]Accuracy

   Our purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical.
   We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism
   are both correct and in context. In our reporting, we rigorously
   challenge both the claims we encounter and the assumptions we bring. We
   devote our resources and our skills to presenting the fullest version
   of the truth we can deliver, placing the highest value on information
   we have gathered and verified ourselves.

     * [81]Using information from non-NPR sources
     * [82]Accuracy online
     * [83]Accuracy in visual journalism
     __________________________________________________________________

[84]Fairness

   To tell the truest story possible, it is essential that we treat those
   we interview and report on with scrupulous fairness, guided by a spirit
   of professionalism. We make every effort to gather responses from those
   who are the subjects of criticism, unfavorable allegations or other
   negative assertions in our stories. What we broadcast and put online is
   edited for time and clarity. Whenever we quote, edit or otherwise
   interpret what people tell us, we aim to be faithful to their meaning,
   so our stories ring true to those we interview. In all our stories,
   especially matters of controversy, we strive to consider the strongest
   arguments we can find on all sides, seeking to deliver both nuance and
   clarity. Our goal is not to please those whom we report on or to
   produce stories that create the appearance of balance, but to seek the
   truth.

     * [88]Fair use
     __________________________________________________________________

[89]Completeness

   We do our best to report thoroughly and tell stories comprehensively.
   We won't always have enough time or space in one story to say
   everything we would like or quote everyone we would wish to include.
   But errors of omission and partial truths can inflict great damage on
   our credibility, and stories delivered without the context to fully
   understand them are incomplete. Our journalism includes diverse voices
   that reflect our society and divergent views that contribute to
   informed debate. When we find that we can't deliver all the answers to
   important questions, we explain what we don't yet know and work to fill
   any gaps in our reporting.

     * [91]Completeness in reporting
     __________________________________________________________________

[92]Honesty

   Journalists who conduct themselves honestly prove themselves worthy of
   trust. In the course of our work, we are genuine and candid. We
   attribute information we receive from others, making perfectly clear to
   our audience what information comes from which source. We avoid
   hyperbole and sensational conjecture. We may sometimes construct
   hypotheticals to help explain issues and events, but we reveal any
   fabrication, and do not otherwise mix fiction with our news reporting.
   We edit and present information honestly, without deception, and we
   identify ourselves as NPR journalists when we report. Only in the
   rarest of instances - such as when public safety is at issue, or when
   lives are at stake - might we disguise our identity or intent when
   reporting. Before we take such a step, we engage in rigorous
   deliberation and consider all alternatives. Then, when we tell the
   story, we fully disclose what we did and why.

     * [95]Honesty in visual journalism
     * [96]Honesty online
     __________________________________________________________________

[97]Independence

   To secure the public's trust, we must make it clear that our primary
   allegiance is to the public. Any personal or professional interests
   that conflict with that allegiance, whether in appearance or in
   reality, risk compromising our credibility. We are vigilant in
   disclosing to both our supervisors and the public any circumstances
   where our loyalties may be divided - extending to the interests of
   spouses and other family members - and when necessary, we recuse
   ourselves from related coverage. Under no circumstances do we skew our
   reports for personal gain, to help NPR's bottom line or to please those
   who fund us. Decisions about what we cover and how we do our work are
   made by our journalists, not by those who provide NPR with financial
   support.

[104]Impartiality

   [Editor's Note: This section was revised on July 7, 2021 to reflect the
   work and thinking of the Ethics Handbook Committee.]

   Our experiences and perspectives are valuable assets to our journalism.
   We enjoy the right to robust personal lives, yet we accept some unique
   professional obligations and limitations. Because our words and actions
   can damage the public's opinion of NPR, we comport ourselves in ways
   that honor our professional impartiality. We have opinions, like all
   people. But the public deserves factual reporting and informed analysis
   without our opinions unduly influencing what they hear or see. So we
   strive to report and produce stories that transcend our biases and
   treat all views fairly. We aggressively challenge our own perspectives
   and pursue a diverse range of others, aiming always to present the
   truth as completely as we can tell it.
     * [105]Impartiality in our personal lives
     * [106]Impartiality in our journalism
     __________________________________________________________________

[107]Transparency

   To inspire confidence in our journalism, it is critical that we give
   the public the tools to evaluate our work. We reveal as much as we
   practically can about how we discover and verify the facts we present.
   We strive to make our decision-making process clear to the public,
   especially when we find ourselves wrestling with tough choices. We
   disclose any relationships, whether with partners or funders, that
   might appear to influence our coverage.
     * [108]Revealing our process
     * [109]Anonymous sources
     __________________________________________________________________

[110]Accountability

   We take full responsibility for our work, so we must always be ready
   and willing to answer for it. Just as careful attention to our sources
   makes a story stronger, careful listening to our public makes our
   journalism better. So we welcome questions or criticisms from our
   stakeholders and to the best of our ability, we respond. Mistakes are
   inevitable. When we make them, we correct them forthrightly, reflect on
   what happened, and learn from them.

     * [112]Interacting with the public
     * [113]Accountability online
     * [114]Legal accountability
     __________________________________________________________________

[115]Respect

   Everyone affected by our journalism deserves to be treated with decency
   and compassion. We are civil in our actions and words, avoiding
   arrogance and hubris. We listen to others. When we ask tough questions,
   we do so to seek answers — not confrontations. We are sensitive to
   differences in attitudes and culture. We minimize undue harm and take
   special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering. And with all
   subjects of our coverage, we are mindful of their privacy as we fulfill
   our journalistic obligations.
     * [116]Respect for sources and subjects of coverage
     * [117]Respect in sensitive circumstances
     * [118]Respect for our audience
     __________________________________________________________________

[119]Excellence

   Our journalism is most valuable when we marry important truths with
   engaging narrative. We take enormous pride in the craftsmanship of our
   storytelling and in the quality of the words, sounds and images we use
   to help illuminate the world. When we edit, it is to add impact and
   clarity to our journalism — never to slant or distort. We don't allow
   what is sensational to obscure what is significant. We aspire to tell
   stories that rise above the maudlin and mundane, avoiding shallow
   sentimentality. Above all, we do our best to faithfully and powerfully
   convey the truth.
     * [120]Excellence in storytelling
     * [121]Excellence in news judgment
     __________________________________________________________________

[122]Putting Principles Into Practice

   We will fulfill the high standard we owe the public if we hold true to
   our principles. Doing so requires that we embrace complexity and
   continually think through difficult decisions. While these principles
   reinforce each other, they also are often in tension. In all
   situations, we balance them against one another, striving to honor our
   mission. This statement is intended not only to serve as a guide, but
   also to provoke ongoing discussion and deliberation - the keys to any
   ethical decision-making process. It should both test and strengthen the
   moral compass that guides each of us in our work. It aims to foster a
   culture that compels and empowers us to exercise our consciences each
   day. We believe it is our shared responsibility to live up to these
   principles.
