   Contact the NPR sponsorship team at National Public Media to learn more
   about opportunities for your brand.

   For more than 45 years, NPR has been working to "create a more informed
   public." Today, that means making its fact-based journalism and
   storytelling accessible everywhere people are - from radio to digital
   and podcasts, and now across events, voice activation and IOT.

   An innovative corporate sponsorship program helps sustain this work and
   fuel the future of NPR. Through collaboration with National Public
   Media, NPR sponsorship opportunities now extend across a growing number
   of platforms including smart speakers and award-winning integrations in
   the NPR.org audio player. On every platform, sponsorship is designed to
   prioritize user experience, offer transparency and fit the aesthetic of
   the NPR environment.

   National Public Media is the exclusive sponsorship sales team for NPR
   and delivers sponsorship revenue to stations across the country.
   Committed to supporting the continued growth of public media, it works
   to ensure sponsorship is valuable to brands and audiences alike, and to
   advance universal best practices in audience research, measurement,
   product design, brand creative and more.

   For additional information on NPR sponsorship opportunities and
   insights on audio advertising, visit [62]nationalpublicmedia.com.

   To connect with National Public Media staff about a speaking
   opportunity or interview request, email Devon Landis at dlandis (at)

   All NPR funding sources, including corporate sponsors, are considered
   under the "access" principle, which means that NPR has no list of
   sources from which funding will not be accepted. However, potential
   conflict of interest and problems of listener misperception, confusion,
   or similar reason regarding the funder's role and/or influence on
   programming will be considered in accepting or rejecting underwriting.
