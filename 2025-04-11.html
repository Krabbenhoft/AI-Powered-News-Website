<h1>US Markets End a Volatile Week with Gains Amidst Tariff Turmoil</h1>

<p>The week ending April 11, 2025, has been marked by extreme volatility in the US and global markets, largely driven by President Donald Trump's trade policies. Initially, Trump announced astronomically high tariffs on numerous countries, aiming to force them into bilateral trade negotiations. This was followed by a partial reversal, granting a 90-day pause on these tariffs for many nations, excluding China, which faced even higher levies.</p>

<h2>Key Developments:</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Tariff Rollout and Reversal:</b> President Trump initiated a strategy of imposing high "reciprocal" tariffs, intending to bring countries to the negotiating table for trade agreements. However, the markets reacted negatively, leading to a partial 90-day pause for most countries, except China.</li>
  <li><b>China's Retaliation:</b> In response to the US tariffs, China escalated the trade war by raising its tariffs on US goods to 125%, signaling a firm stance against the US trade policy. The Chinese Ministry stated that further tariff increases would be "a joke in the history of the world economy."</li>
  <li><b>Market Volatility:</b> The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced unprecedented volatility, with four closings of 1,000-point swings in the past week alone. The S&P 500 fell sharply in the first week of April. Although there was a historic gain on Wednesday after Trump announced the tariff detente, stocks remained below levels prior to these announcements.</li>
  <li><b>Bond Market Concerns:</b> Contrary to typical behavior during economic uncertainty, bond prices fell instead of rising. Investors expressed doubt in US trade policy, fearing the tariffs would harm America. US Treasury yields rose significantly, reaching levels not seen since 2019, and were on track for their worst week since that year.</li>
  <li><b>Federal Reserve Monitoring:</b> The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring market functions and stands ready to intervene should market distress occur. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expects a "kerfuffle" in the Treasury markets, which would likely prompt Federal Reserve intervention.</li>
  <li><b>Oil Price Decline:</b> Oil prices tumbled due to concerns that Trump's trade policies could reduce global demand for travel and transportation, key drivers for fuel consumption. US oil fell below $60 a barrel, nearing a four-year low.</li>
  <li><b>Dollar Weakness:</b> The US dollar weakened, reaching its lowest level in three years, contrary to expectations that tariffs would strengthen the local currency. Investors sold off the dollar, anticipating that America would suffer the most from the trade war.</li>
  <li><b>Gold Surge:</b> Amid economic and political uncertainty, gold prices surged above $3,200 a troy ounce, posting their best week since 2020.</li>
  <li><b>Trade Deal Optimism:</b> Despite market skepticism, the Trump administration remains optimistic about striking bilateral trade agreements. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported that over 70 countries have requested meetings to negotiate deals, prioritizing allies like South Korea and Japan.</li>
  <li><b>Consumer Sentiment Plunge:</b> Consumer sentiment has plummeted to near-record lows, with rising inflation expectations and concerns about the trade war contributing to the pessimism.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economic Impact and Analysis:</h2>

<p>Economists express concerns that the damage from the trade war has already been inflicted, despite potential trade agreements. The likelihood of a recession in the US and global economies this year is estimated to be around 50%. The fluctuating tariffs, particularly the 145% levy on Chinese goods, have created significant uncertainty for businesses and investors, impacting consumer sentiment and market stability.</p>

<h2>Individual Stocks and Sectors:</h2>

<p>Several individual companies and sectors have been affected by the trade situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Tesla:</b> Faced difficulties as it pulled US-made cars from the Chinese market and introduced a cheaper Cybertruck trim in the US due to tariffs and demand shifts.</li>
  <li><b>General Motors:</b> Announced a temporary halt of EV van production in Ontario due to weakening market demand.</li>
  <li><b>Apple:</b> Stock moved lower after China levied more tariffs.</li>
  <li><b>Retailers:</b> Most retailers are anticipated to face higher tariff pressures due to reliance on foreign goods. However domestic retailers may get relief.</li>
</ul>

<p>The stock market is influenced by multiple factors, and Trump administration is making a coin-flip risk for the market and economists due to the trade war with China.</
