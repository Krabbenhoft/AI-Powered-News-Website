<h1>Market Volatility Amid Trade War Concerns</h1>
<p>
On April 11, 2025, financial markets experienced a volatile trading day, marked by significant swings in stock prices, currency values, and bond yields. The primary driver behind this instability appears to be escalating trade tensions, particularly between the United States and China, coupled with concerns about rising inflation and potential economic slowdown.
</p>

<h2>Stock Market Performance</h2>
<p>
The U.S. stock market initially opened lower on Friday, April 11th. However, later in the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 600 points, as the White House indicated optimism for a trade deal with China. This occurred after a turbulent week where major averages plummeted the previous day due to 'risk-off' mode as traders responded to trade policy uncertainty, partially reversing gains from earlier in the week when President Trump announced a 90-day reprieve on some reciprocal tariffs. Despite the day's gains, the S&P 500 is down more than 7% since April 2, when the White House announced reciprocal tariffs. The Nasdaq is also on track for its best weekly performance since November, despite this week's volatility.
</p>

<h2>Trade War Escalation</h2>
<p>
The ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China took center stage, with both nations imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other's goods. The Trump Administration has set a 10% universal tariff rate except for China. Goods from Beijing will see a rate of 145%. China retaliated by raising its levies on U.S. products from 84% to 125%. The Chinese ministry stated that "Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy." This tit-for-tat escalation raised concerns about the potential for a global recession and widespread economic damage.

<h2>Impact on Retail and Steel Industries</h2>
<p>
JPMorgan analysts indicated that most retailers will face higher tariff pressures, especially those in electronics, sporting goods, and home furnishings. They noted that companies must decide whether to pass the increases to consumers or absorb them, facing margin or earnings headwinds respectively. Morgan Stanley suggests steel prices have peaked and will likely decrease as customers work through excess inventory accumulated before tariff announcements. An executive anticipates that prices will fall to $800 per short ton later this year, but remain above the low of about $700 per short ton in the past.

<h2>Currency and Bond Market Reactions</h2>
<p>
Amidst the trade war uncertainty, the U.S. dollar weakened significantly, reaching its lowest level against the yen in 2025. European currencies rallied as concerns about country-specific tariffs that would have hit the European Union and British goods with levies eased. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose as the sell-off in U.S. debt resumed, triggered by President Trump's tariff policies, forcing the administration to rethink its strategy and pause new tariffs on most countries. This flight to safety also led to a rise in gold prices.
</p>

<h2>Economic Concerns and Consumer Sentiment</h2>
<p>
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that the U.S. economy is facing "considerable turbulence" amidst trade and tariff uncertainties. The University of Michigan survey indicated a sharp decline in consumer sentiment, with expected inflation levels surging to their highest level since 1981. This decline was "pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation."
</p>

<h2>Federal Reserve's Position</h2>
<p>
Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari reiterated the central bank's commitment to controlling inflation through monetary policy tightening, but doesn't see "big dislocations yet" in financial markets. He noted that if things worsen, the Fed could help smooth out the financial markets but would not try to keep Treasury yields at a certain level.
</p>

<h2>European Union's Response</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile, the European Union said its trade representative was flying to Washington on Sunday to "try and sign deals," signaling a proactive approach to navigate the evolving global trade landscape.
