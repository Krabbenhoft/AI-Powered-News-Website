[154]It's been a wild rollout of Trump's tariffs. Here's how we got here

   [155]April 2, 2025  President Trump's tariff talk has been big — and
   also unpredictable. He's frequently made threats only to back off or
   shift deadlines. Here, a look at how the tariff agenda has rolled out.

   [156]Since the 1960s, the U.S. has charged a 25% tariff on imported
   pickup trucks — which until this week was ten times the tax on imported
   cars. The extra protection from foreign competition encouraged U.S.
   automakers to concentrate on pickup trucks while largely ceding the
   market for cheaper, smaller vehicles.
