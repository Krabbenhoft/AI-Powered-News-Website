   Former Costa Rica president Óscar Arias Sánchez – a Nobel Peace Prize
   winner – had his U.S. visa revoked by President Trump's U.S. State
   Department this week.

   Arias Sánchez, 84, said in an interview with Morning Edition that U.S.
   Embassy workers in Costa Rica told him his visa was revoked due to his
   close ties with the Chinese government. Arias Sánchez served as
   president of Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990 and then again from 2006 to
   2010. Costa Rica formalized relations with China in 2007.

   Earlier this year, the Nobel Laureate [71]criticized President Trump on
   social media, comparing him to a "Roman emperor" telling the rest of
   the world what to do. Arias Sánchez told NPR he worries those comments
   influenced the decision to revoke his visa.

   "The president has a personality that is not open to criticism or
   disagreements," Arias Sánchez said.

[74]Trump administration advances immigration crackdown on foreign student
protesters

   A State Department spokesperson provided the following statement when
   NPR asked for comment about Arias Sánchez's revoked visa: "Visa records
   are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the
   details of individual visa cases."

   Arias Sánchez spoke to NPR's Leila Fadel about his visa cancellation,
   Trump and how the U.S. is treating the rest of the world.

   Editor's note: Arias Sánchez spoke through an interpreter and in
   English. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

   Arias Sánchez: So I received an email on Tuesday, April 1, that was a
   very short one that said that my B1/B2 visa had been revoked. I called
   the embassy to ask what had happened.

   Leila Fadel: And what did they say?

   Arias Sánchez: They asked me to come into the embassy. Fortunately, I
   live about five minutes away, so I was able to be there in person where
   they somewhat explained what happened.

   They told me my visa was revoked because of my close ties to China.
   During my second administration from 2006 to 2010, I established
   diplomatic relations with China, and that's because it has the second
   largest economy in the world. Costa Rica has a very open economy, and
   its growth relies on international trade. And so in 2007 is when we
   formally established diplomatic relations.

[77]Trump tariffs spark ire and dismay from international leaders

   Fadel: How much do you think your public statements criticizing
   President Trump, comparing him to a Roman emperor played in them,
   suspending your visa?

   Arias Sánchez: I don't know. The embassy workers didn't say that was
   specifically why my visa was revoked and they cited my relationship
   with China. But I have to imagine that my criticism of President Trump
   might have played a role. The president has a personality that is not
   open to criticism or disagreements.

   Fadel: The Trump administration says it's targeting anyone they deem as
   having what they define as a "hostile attitude" to the U.S. What do you
   make of that policy?

   Sponsor Message

   Arias Sánchez: I don't have a hostile attitude towards the United
   States. Friends sometimes agree, sometimes disagree. And concerning
   U.S. policy towards Central America, supporting the Contras militarily
   affected my own country.

   During the Reagan administration, I had a strong disagreement with his
   policy towards the region. But concerning my feelings towards the U.S.
   – you know, my two children were educated in the U.S. My son went to
   Harvard and my daughter went to Boston College. I received more or less
   85 honorary degrees from the best universities in the U.S.

   I am a good friend, but I also have fought for noble causes.

   Note: Throughout the 1980s, the U.S. [78]backed Contra rebels against
   the left-wing Nicaraguan government, an action Arias Sánchez opposed.
   As president, he did not allow the U.S.-backed Contras to operate in
   Costa Rica.

[81]A Chinese scholar shares some thoughts about what Trump is doing to the
U.S.

   Fadel: I think there's so much fascination with your case because
   you're such a known figure and yet your visa was revoked. So what does
   that say about the policy of the U.S. today under this administration?

   Arias Sánchez: Well, I don't agree with it. For a Democrat – and I am a
   true Democrat – criticism is welcome. It's the only way you can build
   agreements. This happened to me when I met with the five Central
   American presidents in August of '87. I had introduced my peace plan in
   the U.S. In a negotiation, you never get what you want. You always get
   what you can.

   And with criticism from adversaries or from the press and freedom of
   the press and freedom of opinion, freedom of expression is a
   prerequisite for any democratic government. So I have benefited myself
   with criticism from all those sources. And it seems to me that
   nowadays, one shouldn't dare to criticize the U.S. because you could be
   punished.
