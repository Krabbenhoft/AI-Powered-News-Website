A hot seat for Musk, the trade war and third-term talk: Takeaways from the
week

   A GOP [65]electoral warning points to Elon Musk in the hot seat, and
   President Trump employs a third-term distraction. Also, the trade war
   rages, and there were mass firings at key scientific agencies.

   It was another week of big headlines as President Trump, in his seventh
   week of his second term, continued to overhaul policy, both foreign and
   domestic.

   Here are four takeaways from the week in our continued look at
   President Trump's first 100 days in office:

   1. Musk in the spotlight after Democrats win in Wisconsin.

   Musk became the central figure in a [66]judicial race in Wisconsin. He
   spent $20 million there and made an appearance in the state just ahead
   of the election, where he raised the stakes. But in a state that Trump
   won by a point in 2024, the Republican-endorsed judicial candidate lost
   on Tuesday by 10 points.

   That's a pretty big loss for the party, but especially for Musk. He put
   a lot on the line there, and given how controversial his team's federal
   cuts have been, that was a big risk. Now, Democrats feel emboldened to
   run against Musk and make him the face of Trump's agenda. Republicans,
   meanwhile, are questioning the world's richest man's political value.

   "I'm honestly shocked," Pam Van Handel, chair of the Republican Party
   of Outagamie County in Wisconsin, told [67]Politico. "I thought we had
   it in the bag. I thought [Musk] was going to be an asset for this race.
   People love Trump, but maybe they don't love everybody he supports.
   Maybe I have blinders on."

   Republicans on Capitol Hill, though, don't want to show any break with
   Trump, and they'd still love Musk's money, but they might not like what
   a wild card he can be. DOGE, his informal Department of Government
   Efficiency, has caused them headaches at town halls, and his comments
   about potentially cutting entitlements is like political kryptonite.

   He's more unpopular than Trump, and this loss in Wisconsin means the
   heat shield he may have been for Trump to be able to absorb negativity
   about federal government restructuring is melting. It appears political
   gravity is setting in for Musk, and don't be surprised if he's out
   after his 130-day special government employee status expires at the end
   of next month.

   Convention Center on March 30 in Green Bay, Wisc., ahead of the state’s
   high-profile Supreme Court election between Circuit Court Judge Brad
   Schimel, who has been financially backed by Musk and endorsed by
   President Donald Trump, and Dane County Circuit Court Judge Susan
   Crawford.

   Then Republicans will be hoping he stays quiet and just writes the
   checks.

   2. Trump's real goals in floating a third term: Distract from bad news
   and try not to be a lame duck.

   In politics, to stay relevant, you never want to completely wave people
   off from the notion that you're at least thinking about running for
   president. But what do you do when you're president and facing a
   [68]constitutional amendment that bars you from running again?

   Cryptically [69]say you're looking at ways to do it, and float at least
   one far-flung theory that's remotely possible. That's what Trump did
   this week when he told NBC's Kristen Welker that his team is looking at
   it and that he's "not joking." He was more cagey the next day when
   NPR's Tamara Keith pressed him on Air Force One about the comments.
   Trump repeatedly said he didn't want to talk about it, that's it's far
   off and didn't commit to leaving the White House on Jan. 20, 2029 when
   the next president should be sworn in.

   Trump's provocative comments serve a few of other political purposes:
   (1) set the stage to run for an unconstitutional third term by
   normalizing the idea of something abnormal that chips away at
   democratic norms; (2) help avoid being a lame duck — if people think
   it's possible he runs again, then his agenda matters more in his last
   two years than a traditionally term-limited president would be; and (3)
   distract from bad news — like the Signal chat group controversy that
   was still getting attention when he made the comments and his trade war
   that is ringing market alarm bells around the world all while
   continuing to make drastic cuts at key federal agencies.

   3. Trump tries to build the wall — of tariffs. Get ready for higher
   prices.

   "A lot of people are tired of watching the other countries ripping off
   the United States," Trump said, adding, "They laugh at us. Behind our
   backs, they laugh at us because of our own stupidity."

   Trump on Wednesday announcing his broad, sweeping tariffs on the U.S.'s
   top trading partners all over the world? No. It was him in 1987
   [70]talking about tariffs on Larry King Live. Trump has long loved the
   idea of tariffs — first on Japan, then when its economy went into
   recession, he shifted his gaze to China.

   But it's never great policy to be ideologically rigid and not adjust
   with the times. Trump's trade war is now roiling markets, and experts
   are warning of higher prices and slower growth, as well as potential
   recessions in other countries.

   What's more, these tariffs are coming after an election when prices
   were the top concern for voters — and Trump made a pretty big promise.

   "When I win, I will immediately bring prices down," Trump said in
   August of last year.

   Well, not immediately, clearly. After he was elected, he said bringing
   prices down would be "hard." After being sworn in, he said, actually,
   he never thought inflation was really the top issue in the campaign,
   anyway — that it was immigration.

   "[Y]ou can only talk about it so long," Trump [71]told House
   Republicans a week after he was inaugurated. "The price of apples
   doubled; the price of bacon has quadrupled; everything is a disaster.
   And you say it — and then what do you do?"

   This lack of a focus on bringing down prices in the short term — and
   actively likely making them higher — is a serious political gamble
   Trump is taking for his party. He believes he can convince people to
   give him the space to set the country on a track to bring back more
   manufacturing by building a wall of tariffs.

   But so far, they aren't. In fact, his economic approval ratings have
   been trending downward and below his overall rating. Two polls this
   week, [72]AP/NORC and [73]Reuters/Ipsos, show Trump's overall approval
   at his lowest point since being sworn in for his second term — 42% and
   43%, respectively.

   His economic approval in AP's poll is 40%, while in Reuters' it's 37%,
   including just 30% for his efforts to lower the cost of living.

   4. The federal cuts hit health agencies.

   Speaking of other substantive things Trump may be trying to distract
   from, his administration began firing some 10,000 staffers at the
   Department of Health and Human Services this week.

   The cuts included [74]leaders and [75]some of the country's leading
   scientists and researchers, as well as the forcing out of the Food and
   Drug Administration's top vaccine regulator, Dr. Peter Marks.

   Despite that, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. claimed in an
   [76]interview last week on NewsNation, "We're not cutting scientists.
   We're not cutting frontline workers."

   He talked of trying to make the "sprawling" agencies, as he called
   them, more efficient when it comes to things like human resources and
   communications. It's possible that there were mistakes made in who
   received reduction-in-force notices, as there have been with some of
   the other cuts made.

   But many see dangers to the country in what's already been done.

   "It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the
   secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his
   misinformation and lies," [77]Marks wrote in his letter of resignation.

   Dr. Ashish Jha, who was President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator
   and is currently dean of the Brown University School of Public Health,
   [78]told NPR: "I'm worried that what we're going to see is more people
   getting sick, more disease outbreaks and infrastructure that is going
   to be less and less capable of responding to those threats."

   Wendy Armstrong, director of infectious diseases at the University of
   Colorado and vice president of the Infectious Diseases Society of
   America, was even more blunt in an [79]interview with The Bulwark:
   "It's astounding. It will affect patients with all kinds of different
   kinds of infections, and Americans will suffer, and people will die,
   and that's a horrible thing to see coming."

   Over several decades, the United States has become a leader in science
   research, relied upon not just domestically but internationally. That's
   because agencies under HHS like the National Institutes of Health,
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug
   Administration study and help fund and develop breakthroughs in
   everything from autism and cancer to neurological disease.

   They're gatekeepers for the medicines Americans take, and they're on
   the front lines of helping to stop the spread of infectious diseases
   and help develop vaccines that help prevent the spread of pandemics.

   These agencies had long had bipartisan support and were among the most
   trusted in the federal government. But COVID changed all that. Largely
   because of widespread online misinformation given credence by political
   leaders on the right, these agencies became lightning rods and
   officials were vilified by MAGA.

   Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican and chairman of the Senate
   Health committee, is calling on Kennedy to testify to explain the cuts.

   to enter the Mary E. Switzer Memorial Building on April 2. Layoffs
   began earlier this week at the agency after it was announced last week
   that the Trump administration plans to cut 10,000 HHS jobs.

   "The news coverage on the HHS reorg is being set by anonymous sources
   and opponents are setting the perceptions," Cassidy said in a
   [80]statement. "In the confirmation process, RFK committed to coming
   before the committee on a quarterly basis. This will be a good
   opportunity for him to set the record straight and speak to the goals,
   structure and benefits of the proposed reorganization."

   Here's a day-by-day look at what happened in the past week:

   Friday, March 28:
     * In Greenland, Vice President Vance says the U.S. can't ignore the
       encroachment of Russia and China there. On the Signal controversy,
       he says that it is in the U.S. interest to preserve navigation, but
       that it has to be done "right." He adds that he "always supported"
       Trump striking the Houthis. "Our message to Denmark is very
       simple," Vance says, "you have not done a good job by the people of
       Greenland. You have under-invested in the people of Greenland, and
       you have under-invested in the security architecture of this
       incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That
       has to change, and because it hasn't changed, this is why President
       Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is." He also says that using
       military force to obtain the island is not what the administration
       wants. Trump previously said that was not off the table.
     * Trump [81]says on social media that he is nominating Sara Carter
       director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Carter, a
       Fox News contributor, has focused on stories involving drug
       trafficking, immigration and national security. The position
       requires Senate confirmation.
     * In a 2-1 ruling, an appeals court [82]clears the way for Trump to
       fire officials in quasi-independent government agencies.
     * Texas health officials have confirmed [83]400 reported measles
       cases since the outbreak began there in January. That's a jump of
       77 new cases since Tuesday. This year, the U.S. has reported more
       than [84]480 measles cases in 20 states. That's more cases than in
       all of 2024.
     * The top vaccine official at the FDA is forced out, and he
       [85]didn't mince words in his resignation letter.
     * Trump [86]commutes the sentence of Carlos Watson, Ozy co-founder,
       who was convicted in a financial conspiracy case. He was set to
       report just hours later for a 10-year prison sentence. (Watson
       served as a corporate director of NPR, but [87]stepped down from
       his company in 2021 amid allegations of wrongdoing at his company.)
     * The FCC [88]is investigating Disney and ABC over diversity
       policies.

   Saturday:
     * Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., has a contentious town hall. She says
       the Signal chat was "[89]actually very bad."
     * The White House Correspondents Association [90]cancels the comedian
       it had booked for its annual dinner later this month. The
       organization's president said in a statement that "[at] this
       consequential moment for journalism, I want to ensure the focus is
       not on the politics of division, but entirely on awarding our
       colleagues for their outstanding work and providing scholarship and
       mentorship to the next generation of journalists."

   Sunday:
     * Trump tells NBC that he's "not joking" that he's [91]thinking about
       running again and his team has looked into ways of doing it.
     * He also tells [92]NBC News he's "angry" — even "pissed off" —  with
       Russian President Vladimir Putin over comments that Ukraine
       President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader. Trump
       threatens Russia with more sanctions on Russian oil if a peace deal
       isn't struck.
     * Of tariffs potentially raising car prices, Trump says: "I couldn't
       care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start
       buying American-made cars. … I couldn't care less. I hope they
       raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy
       American-made cars. … [I]f the prices on foreign cars go up,
       they're going to buy American cars."
     * Iran rejects direct talks with the U.S. Iranian President
       Pezeshkian [93]says: "We don't avoid talks; it's the breach of
       promises that has caused issues for us so far. They must prove that
       they can build trust."
     * France [94]balks at a letter sent from the State Department to
       French companies saying a presidential executive order on
       diversity, equity and inclusion also applies to French companies
       who do business in the U.S.
     * Greenland's prime minister [95]pushes back on Trump assertions that
       the U.S. will take the island: "President Trump says that the
       United States 'will get Greenland.' Let me be clear: The United
       States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide
       our own future."
     * A University of Minnesota graduate student is [96]detained by ICE.
     * Wisconsin's attorney general [97]asks a judge to stop Elon Musk's
       $1 million payments to voters.
     * The administration [98]plans overseas firings of U.S. Institute of
       Peace employees.
     * Musk holds a[99] town hall in Wisconsin, where he wears a cheese
       hat and notes that depopulation is the greatest problem facing
       humanity.
     * The White House [100]intends to take over the seating of
       correspondents in the briefing room.
     * The [101]Wall Street Journal reports that National Security Adviser
       Mike Waltz has hosted other Signal chat rooms with sensitive
       material, including about Ukraine.
     * [102]AP/NORC poll finds Trump's approval rating dropping to 42%
       overall and 40% on the economy. He does best on immigration at 49%.

       production company, Embassy and Third, and working on social media
       and podcasts at The Hudson Institute."

     * The administration [112]deports 17 more people to El Salvador
       despite a court order blocking the flights. The administration is
       using a different justification calling them counterterrorism
       efforts.

     * Global markets [152]are down because of tariffs. There are
       questions about [153]how they were calculated. Former Treasury
       Secretary Larry Summers [154]says of the tariffs: "It's now clear
       that the Trump administration computed reciprocal tariffs without
       using tariff data. This is to economics what creationism is to
       biology, astrology is to astronomy, or RFK thought is to vaccine
       science."
     * Political leaders around the world are [155]upset with the tariffs.

       [156]hold off on U.S. investments for now.
     * Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says Trump "is [157]not

       conspicuously [158]left off Trump's tariff list.

       cost of $2,100 over the year.

       will do more harm than good and will hurt someone close to them.
     * [169]Multiple [170]news [171]outlets [172]report that Trump fired

       far-right conspiracy theorist and activist Laura Loomer, who
       questioned their loyalty.
     * Senators voted, in a [173]nonbinding resolution, to overturn
       Trump's 25% tariffs on Canada. Four Republicans voted with

       Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky.
       McConnell and Paul are concerned about the effect on exports of
       Kentucky bourbon. Collins cited her concerns over tourism, farming
       and lobster processing.

       programs to advantage one's race over another -- is impermissible."
