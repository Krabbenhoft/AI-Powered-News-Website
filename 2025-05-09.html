    <h1>May 9, 2025: US-China Trade Talks Loom, Market Reacts to Trade Developments and Earnings Reports</h1>

    <p>
        The financial markets are bracing for crucial trade talks between the United States and China this weekend in Switzerland, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on the American side. This follows a preliminary trade agreement reached between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the first such deal under President Trump's "reciprocal" tariff policy announced in early April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a drop of over 100 points on Friday as investors awaited these talks, indicating some uncertainty.

        President Trump has signaled a potential de-escalation with China, suggesting an "80% Tariff on China seems right" in a Truth Social post. This is a significant reduction from the current 145% tariff but still higher than anticipated by many, as some expected rates could fall below 60% this week. It remains unclear whether this is a long-term or temporary measure during negotiations. The president also reiterated that China should open its markets to the U.S.

        Federal Reserve Governor Michael Barr has cautioned that tariffs could lead to higher inflation and potentially slower economic growth, a sentiment echoed by economists who fear disruption to global supply chains. Despite these concerns, Barclays suggests investors continue to "don't fight Trump" as the president aims to secure more trade deals.
