<h1>May 9, 2025: US Markets React to Trade Talk Developments and Earnings Reports</h1>

<p>
The US stock market experienced a volatile trading day on Friday, May 9, 2025, primarily influenced by anticipation surrounding upcoming trade talks between the United States and China. These discussions, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland, are crucial as investors weigh the potential for de-escalation in the ongoing trade war. This follows a preliminary trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the first deal between the U.S. and a major trading partner since President Trump's earlier "reciprocal" tariff announcement in early April.
</p>

<h2>Key Trade Developments and Presidential Commentary</h2>
<p>
President Trump's statements on Truth Social have added further uncertainty to the trade outlook. A day after announcing the preliminary U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, Trump suggested that an "80% Tariff on China seems right," a remark made just ahead of high-level trade discussions. While this represents a reduction from the current 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods, it still exceeds prior expectations that tariffs could be lowered below 60% relatively soon. This uncertainty around the duration of these rates creates instability, and concern in the market, causing strategists at Nationwide to call this a "sideways period of volatility". 
</p>

<p>
The President's aggressive stance contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's stance, which warned that tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth. Despite these concerns, the US has also offered India to cut tariffs in return for more open trade, which would see India slash its tariff gap with the U.S. to less than 4%.

<h2>Market Performance and Sectoral Analysis</h2>

<p>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 100 points, reflecting investor hesitancy. The S&P 500, a broader market index, closed little changed as investors await the outcome of U.S.-China trade discussions. In the past, Barclays has encouraged investors to follow President Trumps cues while negotiating trade deals. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs cautions that even though the U.S. has reached a trade agreement with the U.K. and China relations are thawing, this may not be the case for all countries.
</p>
<p>
Energy stocks outperformed, boosted by rising oil and natural gas prices. Energy stocks were the top performing sector in midday trading, and oil prices have been pushing to a level above $60 per barrel. Conversely, GE Healthcare is expected to benefit if the U.S. and China reach a trade deal, which the Bank of America said because bilateral tariffs between the two countries have hurt them more than any other large cap medtech.

<h2>Individual Stock Movements and Analyst Ratings</h2>

<p>
Several companies experienced notable stock movements based on earnings reports and analyst ratings:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Affirm:</b> Susquehanna International Group upgraded Affirm, a "buy now, pay later" stock, to a positive rating from neutral, citing strong quarterly results, specifically highlighting the 115% growth in Affirm Card volume. However, the company's forward guidance disappointed Wall Street, with revenue expectations below consensus estimates.</li>
    <li><b>Tapestry (Coach, Kate Spade):</b> Morgan Stanley upgraded Tapestry to overweight, noting the company's tariff resilience and brand momentum. Tapestry confirmed tariff resilience, citing minimal impact on their '25e outlook, and other key offsets, proactive inventory pull-forward, supplier partner negotiations, and pricing power.</li>
    <li><b>Lyft:</b> Jumped more than 20% after lifting its buyback plan and reporting better-than-expected gross bookings. The CEO remarked that the company isn't seeing "anything to worry about" despite concerns of a slowing consumer.</li>
    <li><b>Monster Beverage:</b> Rose to a fresh all-time high. It's the top-performing stock among current S&P 500 members over the past 30 years.</li>
    <li><b>Microchip Technology:</b> Shares surged after issuing a better-than-expected forecast.</li>
    <li><b>Expedia Group:</b> Stock tumbled after weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economic Indicators and Consumer Spending</h2>
<p>
Recent data indicates weak spending trends in April, with total household credit and debit card spending rising only 1% year-over-year, according to Bank of America. Spending was soft in several categories, including airlines, clothing, and home improvement, but this weakness may be offset by front loading in certain categories ahead of tariffs such as online electronics.
