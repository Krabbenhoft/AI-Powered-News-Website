   In 2021, the Tiny Desk x globalFEST series was created to promote
   international music discovery. For the fifth edition, we present
   artists from Cabo Verde, France and Colombia.

   From the very first song, there is no question that we are immersed in
   the rich and vibrant sound of Colombia's Caribbean coast. Led by
   co-founders and lead vocalists Johanna Castañeda and Ronald Polo, the
   members of REBOLU dig deep into their roots to captivate audiences
   everywhere they play, including the Tiny Desk.

   Grounded in the musical traditions of the African diaspora, REBOLU's
   performance reflects both the uptempo and the slow grooves that have
   evolved in Colombia — what makes their music, and this Tiny Desk, stand
   out is how they incorporate contemporary rhythms like reggae and funk
   into their sound. You may not have known them before, but once you do,
   REBOLU will have you coming back for more.
