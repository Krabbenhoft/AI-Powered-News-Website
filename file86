[118]Five Fingers Crush The Land from NPR's Throughline

   December 19, 2024 • As NPR correspondent Emily Feng reported in our
   three-part series "The Black Gate," hundreds of thousands of Uyghur
   people have been detained in China. They've been subjected to torture,
   forced labor, religious restrictions, and even forced sterilization. In
   this episode from 2021, our colleagues at the history podcast
   Throughline explore who the Uyghur people are, their land, their
   customs, their music and how they've become such a target in China
   today. To listen to this series sponsor-free and support NPR, sign up

[122]The Black Gate: Arresting Your Brothers and Sisters

   December 19, 2024 • As NPR correspondent Emily Feng reported on the
   Kucar family, she encountered a mysterious figure working to keep her
   sources from speaking out. Later, she meets another Uyghur man who -
   perhaps unwillingly - becomes an actor within China's systems of
   control. These men are accused of working to silence others, but they
   say they've found themselves silenced as well. To listen to this series

   find his children, who have been sent to state-run "boarding schools,"
   and his wife, who has spent two years in prison. They're among hundreds
   of thousands of Uyghurs arrested and detained over the years. Kucar is
   trying to do what is virtually impossible in China: bring his loved
   ones home for good. To listen to this series sponsor-free and support

[140]Introducing The Black Gate from NPR

   December 2, 2024 • This is the story of a people being erased, one
   family at a time. For almost a decade, the Chinese government has been
   detaining hundreds of thousands of ethnic Uyghurs in what critics call
   a systematic attempt to dismantle their culture. And since the
   beginning, NPR correspondent Emily Feng has reported on these
   detentions, which were described by the United Nations as possibly
   constituting crimes against humanity. In this three-part series, Emily
   follows one man desperately trying to reunite with his wife and
   children. Along the way, she uncovers surprising new details about some
   of the Uyghurs enabling this massive surveillance state. To listen to
   this series sponsor-free and support NPR, sign up for Embedded+ in
