   March 27, 2025 • The Fifth Amendment. You have the right to remain
   silent when you're being questioned in police custody, thanks to the
   Fifth's protection against self-incrimination. But most people end up
   talking to police anyway. Why? Today on Throughline's We the People:
   the Fifth Amendment, the right to remain silent, and how hard it can be
   to use it.

   moment in the not-so-distant past when we learned what drove the

   have helped save humans from the same fate. In this episode, we'll take
   a journey from prehistoric times to the nuclear age and explore how

   health insurance. But that's not the case in many other wealthy

[124]The Evolution of Presidential Power

   February 20, 2025 • What can and can't the president do — and how do we
   know? The framers of the U.S. Constitution left the powers of the
   executive branch powers deliberately vague, and in doing so opened the
   door for every president to decide how much power they could claim.
   Over time, that's become quite a lot. This episode originally ran in
   2020 and has been updated with new material.

[130]The Anti-Vaccine Movement

   February 13, 2025 • The alleged link between vaccines and autism was
   first published in 1998, in a since-retracted study in medical journal
   The Lancet. The claim has been repeatedly disproven: there is no
   evidence that vaccines and autism are related. But by the mid-2000s,
   the myth was out there, and its power was growing, fueled by distrust
   of government, misinformation, and high-profile boosters like Jim
   Carrey and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. In this episode: the roots of the
   modern anti-vaccine movement, and of the fears that still fuel it –
   from a botched polio vaccine, to the discredited autism study, to
   today.

   February 6, 2025 • Wong Kim Ark was born in the U.S. and lived his
   whole life here. But when he returned from a trip to China in August of
   1895, officials wouldn't let him leave his ship. Citing the Chinese
   Exclusion Act, which denied citizenship to Chinese immigrants, they
   told him he was not, in fact, a citizen of the United States.
