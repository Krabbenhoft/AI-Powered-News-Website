   The history of filibustering, before Cory Booker's speech Sen. Cory
   Booker's record-breaking Senate speech wasn't technically a filibuster,
   but it still put the word in focus. Here's what to know about its
   history, from the swashbuckling to the stonewalling.

Word of the Week: The swashbuckling origins and evolution of 'filibuster'

   Sen. Cory Booker's impassioned oration against the policies of
   President Trump's administration — with the help of multiple fellow
   Democrats — didn't just break the record for the longest Senate floor
   speech in history. It also renewed a spotlight on a time-honored
   tradition.

   The New Jersey Democrat spent a consecutive 25 hours and 5 minutes
   [64]standing and speaking at the podium Monday night into Tuesday,
   captivating [65]hundreds of thousands of viewers and sending [66]Google
   searches skyrocketing for the word "filibuster."

   The catch? While no less impressive, Booker's efforts didn't
   technically constitute a filibuster, since he wasn't seeking to block a
   specific bill or nomination.

   The term refers to action "designed to prolong debate and delay or
   prevent a vote on a bill, resolution, amendment, or other debatable
   question," according to the [70]U.S. Senate.

   "That can have an effect of just raising attention for the issue that
   the senator is talking about … or it can be a means to literally give
   more time for senators to have the backroom conversations to dilute the
   bill that is for some reason objectionable to the senator," explains
   Casey Burgat, Legislative Affairs Program Director at George Washington
   University's Graduate School of Political Management.
   [71]Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., speaks to journalists at the Capitol on
   April 1, 2025. Booker obliterated a record long held by the late Strom
   Thurmond, speaking out for more than 25 hours in protest against
   President Trump's actions since taking office in January.

   The delay tactic is as old as the Senate itself, where the rules permit
   unlimited debate. It has been used prolifically — and controversially —
   throughout the decades, including when then-Democrat Strom Thurmond
   filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for over 24 hours, setting
   the record that Booker broke this week.

   Booker's speech has, ironically, put the filibuster in focus. And while
   the act itself may be considered dull, the word's history and use over
   time are anything but. NPR's first installment of Word of the Week
   traces its evolution, from swashbuckling to stonewalling.

Where did the word come from?

   "Filibuster" was originally used to describe an unauthorized military
   adventurer, specifically "an American engaged in fomenting
   insurrections in Latin America in the mid-19th century," [74]according
   to Merriam-Webster.

   It comes directly from the Spanish word "filibustero," which translates
   to freebooter or pirate.

   When the word first arrived in English in the 1840s, it was used to
   describe [78]Americans who went to foreign countries to fight in their
   wars without the U.S. government's permission. But before long it moved
   to the political sphere, where it became shorthand for stalling
   senators.

   The practice of delaying legislation by giving long speeches dates back
   to the very first session of the Senate in 1789, [79]the chamber says,
   but it wasn't until the 1850s that it became commonplace enough to earn
   its colorful name.

   It first appeared in Congress as a metaphor, after one debate got so
   long it seemed to be disrupting government business. The implication
   was that filibustering [80]lawmakers were pirates, raiding the
   institution for their own political gain.

   The term caught on quickly in the debate-friendly Senate, [81]as NPR
   has reported. In January 1853, for example, Mississippi Democrat Albert
   Brown commented, "I saw my friend standing on the other side of the
   House filibustering."

   "A month later, North Carolina senator George Badger complained of
   'filibustering speeches,' and the term became a permanent part of our
   political lexicon," reads the U.S. Senate website.

   By the 1870s, the filibuster had become both a fixture of the political
   process and a noun — though it was initially applied to the person who
   gave the speeches, rather than the act of speaking itself,
   Merriam-Webster says.

How has the word been used over time?

   The filibuster — a marathon speech by a small group of senators or an
   enterprising individual — has been immortalized in popular culture, in
   large part thanks to Frank Capra's 1939 film [85]Mr. Smith Goes to
   Washington.

   In the movie, idealist freshman Sen. Jefferson Smith (played by James
   Stewart) finds himself at odds with a corrupt political machine, whose
   leaders try to destroy his reputation when he attempts to expose them.
   In the climax of the film, he stages a [87]one-man filibuster to
   proclaim his innocence, which ran over 23 hours and ended only after he
   collapsed in exhaustion on the Senate floor.

   "We have this big conception in our head, at least the public does, of
   what a filibuster is, of the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington … standing on
   your principles-type of senatorial behavior," Burgat told NPR. "But
   that's increasingly rare in the Senate, where the filibuster is not
   used all that often."

[90]25 hours? Before Cory Booker, there was 'Mr. Smith'

   There have been some famous filibusters in the real-life Senate, like a
   [91]1917 speech in which Wisconsin Sen. Robert La Follette opposed U.S.
   entry into World War I and nearly hurled a spittoon at the presiding
   officer after losing his temper. In 1953, Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon
   protested against the Submerged Lands Act for 22 hours and 26 minutes —
   now the third-longest such speech in history, according to the Senate
   Historical Office, thanks to Booker's new record.

   Thurmond — who held the record for almost seven decades — was one of
   many southern Democrats who used the filibuster to successfully delay
   the passage of civil rights legislation by about a decade in the
   mid-20th century, says Burgat.

   "[The Civil Rights Era] seems to be the historical peak," he said. "And
   then we transitioned into an era of the silent or assumed filibusters,
   as these margins got closer and closer."

   In today's era of partisanship and small majorities, he says, senators
   who are opposed to pieces of legislation don't necessarily need to
   actually make a big speech on the floor.

[92]Politics

[93]Famous Filibusters Throughout History

   Because 60 votes are required to cut off debate ([94]known as cloture)
   — and effectively, pass a law — if a group of 41 or more senators
   simply threatens a filibuster, the Senate majority leader can just
   refuse to call a vote, the [95]Brennan Center for Justice explains.

   "And then that filibuster comes off the Senate floor and is actually
   silent in that they don't have to hold the floor, stand up and recite
   Green Eggs and Ham," Burgat explains, nodding to the fact that senators
   often [96]read books or speeches aloud to pass the time while
   filibustering.

   "It's really just assumed, and the majority doesn't even make them go
   through that process … because they would rather process other
   senatorial business."

   That's not to say there haven't been filibusters — or Booker-style
   long, public speeches — on the Senate in recent years. Some standouts
   include a nearly 15-hour [97]filibuster by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,
   for gun control legislation in 2016, and a more than [98]21-hour effort
   by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to defund the Affordable Care Act in 2013.

Why does the word matter today?

   In recent years, talk of reforming the filibuster has been almost as
   widespread as the practice itself.

   The Senate has changed the rules of filibustering several times over
   the decades, like reducing the number of votes required for cloture in
   1975 and allowing a simple majority to end debate on nominations in the
   2010s.

   Critics of the filibuster point to its racist past — former President
   Barack Obama called it a [99]"Jim Crow relic" — and impact on
   productivity. Some politicians have proposed further changes or
   eliminating it altogether.

   "The critiques are often convenient politically, in that: I hate it
   when I'm in the majority and it's stalling me, I love it when I'm in
   the minority and I need to do the stalling," Burgat says, though he
   predicts the filibuster is likely to undergo changes eventually.

   Former President Joe Biden [103]said in 2022 that he supported
   scrapping the filibuster in order to codify abortion and voting rights,
   for example. While many Democrats were on board then, Burgat says they
   are likely grateful for the filibuster now, with a
   Republican-controlled Congress and White House.

   Burgat considers Booker's use of the right to unlimited debate, in full
   public view, as a boon for democracy at a time when [104]trust in
   institutions is historically low.

   "Though it didn't stall any piece of legislation, he got the
   conversation he was after. And to me, that's the senator's job," he
   said.

   He says part of the reason that we don't see such speeches very often
   these days is because of how physically taxing it is to stay upright
   and talking — without leaving for a bathroom break — for so long. A
   hoarse Booker, by the way, told reporters afterward that he had cut out
   food and water long before he took the podium.

   Still, Burgat is surprised that more senators haven't tried to take
   advantage of the opportunity to go viral — and says Booker's speech
   could potentially inspire others to do the same.

   "I want them talking to each other, even if they're fundamentally
   disagreeing with each other. That's how it's supposed to work," he
   says.
