   In Death of a Unicorn, actors Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega play a father
   and daughter driving deep into the wilderness when they hit a unicorn.

   Rudd's character, Elliot, isn't quite sure the unicorn is dead. So, he
   bludgeons the magical beast with a tire iron.

   "Just to put it out of its misery," Rudd told Morning Edition's Leila
   Fadel. "It's thoughtful, but gruesome."

   Thoughtful, but gruesome is an apt descriptor for the film as well. As
   it turns out, hitting a unicorn isn't quite like hitting a squirrel.
   The unicorns in this film are a lot more vengeful and organized. What
   starts out as a dark comedy turns into a unicorn gore-fest.

   Death of a Unicorn, [70]written and directed by Alex Scharfman,
   premiered March 28 in theaters.

   Scharfman and Rudd joined Morning Edition via a somewhat unsteady
   smartphone app. During our conversation with the two, Scharfman's
   connection dropped. Rudd used the opportunity to share some choice
   words about his director.

   The following conversation is edited for length and clarity.

   Alex Scharfman:

   I really had no interest in unicorns at the outset, but it sort of led
   me down a rabbit hole of exploration of unicorn mythology and unicorn
   lore. And at some point, it clicked into place that it was a way to
   tell a contemporary version of a creature feature and do my own version
   of it.

   Leila Fadel:

   And also, I had no idea that the lore around unicorns was that they are
   these vengeful creatures, because my experience with unicorns is, like,
   My Little Pony unicorns.

   Scharfman:

   Yeah. Well, most of our experience with unicorns today is My Little
   Pony stuff. But the truth is, that only goes back, like, 50, 75 years…
   (silence)

   Fadel:

   Did we lose Alex? Alex?

   Paul Rudd:

   I think he might have just been impaled by a unicorn. (laughter) But
   this is good. Honestly, can I tell you about Alex?

   Sponsor Message

   Fadel:

   Yeah. Like, tell me the truth.

   Rudd:

   Oh, this guy. Oh, God. It's all unicorns with this guy, honestly.

   Scharfman:

   Better now?

   Rudd:

   Oh, hey, he's back. He's back. Yes, we can hear you.

   Fadel:

   Yes. And Paul was not saying anything rude while you were gone.
   (laughter)

   Rudd:

   No. I was singing your praises.

   Fadel:

   OK. So you were saying that only goes back 50 or 75 years, and then I
   lost you.

   Scharfman:

   Oh, yeah. We've had them in our Western culture for almost 2,500 years.
   The first written account of a unicorn was around 400 BC. But, for most
   of human history, it used to be very different, and it used to have
   this much more primal, ancient god kind of quality to it.

   Fadel:

   So they discover this unicorn. You've thrown it in the trunk after
   bludgeoning it. You play a fairly timid lawyer who's dragging his
   daughter to a wilderness preserve and it's owned by a wealthy, big
   pharma family he's trying to do business with, and you take it to the
   home of this really wealthy family. That family discovers that the
   unicorn's body has healing properties and it puts your character in a
   bind. If you could talk about that and what happens between you and
   your daughter, played by Jenna Ortega.
   Death of a Unicorn poses the question: Who are the real monsters?

   Rudd:

   Yes, well, I'm playing this guy, Elliot, who is a father first and also
   a recently widowed father. And in an effort to be a good parent and
   make sure that we're taken care of, securing some kind of deal here
   with this family is important. Obviously, listening to your child and
   making the correct moral decisions is also important.

   And I think my character spends a great deal of this film with one foot
   in each camp and trying his best to balance it out and do what he
   believes is really right in the long run, because he knows best — or so
   he thinks.

   Fadel:

   Where did you draw from there, Alex, writing that into the movie?

   Scharfman:

   That notion that I think is tied also to Paul's character's arc, is
   this question of moral relativism and do the ends justify the means?
   And can we convince ourselves that what we want to do is maybe more
   morally appropriate or acceptable than it actually is? And how we all
   kind of go about our daily lives of maybe convincing ourselves that
   what we're after is more honorable than perhaps it could be.

   Fadel:

   The unicorns are scary, but the humans might be just as scary — the
   really wealthy ones.

   Scharfman:

   Yes. That was part of the thinking was, like, a monster movie where the
   real monsters are the people.

   Fadel:

   Yeah. And, Paul, you've had this really successful, long career in
   film. How much horror have you done?

   Rudd:

   Some of the things I've done could be described that way, but
   unintentionally, I would say.

   When it comes to actual, technical horror, not that much. This was
   maybe the second. I don't really know. You know, the very first movie I
   ever did was a Halloween movie. And that was terrifying for a number of
   reasons.

   But, yeah, it was somewhat new to me. I hadn't had a ton of experience
   working on scary stuff.

   Fadel:

   Is there a genre you're, like, no. I'll never do this.

   Rudd:

   Snuff films. I put my foot down. (laughter)

   That's where I draw the line. Other than that, my line is always open.
   Email me, call, text.

   Scharfman:

   I was going to send you my new script, too, Paul, and now I'm not going
   to.

   Rudd:

   I'm sorry. I'm very busy.
