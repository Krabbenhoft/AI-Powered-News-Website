   [204]March 19, 2025  In the gleefully grisly action movie Novocaine,
   Jack Quaid plays a sweet, nerdy guy who does not experience physical
   pain. He falls for a woman (Amber Midthunder) who's determined to get
   him to leave his safe, risk-averse life behind. That happens in a big
   and very bloody way when she gets kidnapped by bank robbers, and he
   sets out to rescue her.
