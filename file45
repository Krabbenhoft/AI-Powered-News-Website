   Trade war escalates as China hits back with 34% tariffs on all U.S.
   goods Analysts say the escalating trade tensions between the U.S and
   China will make a near-term deal to end the trade war "highly
   unlikely".

Trade war escalates as China hits back with 34% tariffs on all U.S. goods

   BEIJING - China has hit back at new U.S. tariffs with sweeping levies
   of its own on American products, sharply escalating the trade war
   between the world's two biggest economies.

   China's [64]finance ministry said on Friday a 34% tariff will be
   imposed on all U.S. imports from April 10, mirroring President Trump's
   levy on Chinese goods that was announced as part of his global tariff
   blitz on Wednesday.

   "China urges the United States to immediately lift its unilateral
   tariff measures and resolve its trade differences through consultations
   in an equal, respectful and mutually beneficial manner," the ministry
   said in a statement.

[67]Trump tariffs spark ire and dismay from international leaders

   The research firm Capital Economics said the Chinese retaliation did
   not bode well for prospects of finding a resolution.

   "This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal
   to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely," its
   analysts wrote in a note.

   But the new Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods do not bring China's
   across-the-board levies to the same level as those of the U.S. on
   Chinese goods. Prior to Wednesday, Trump had already imposed tariffs of
   20% on Chinese products, and his latest move took the overall rate to
   54%. China had [68]responded to those earlier tariffs with targeted
   tariffs of its own and other measures.

American companies are also affected

   The latest Chinese countermeasures also included restrictions on U.S.
   companies and rare earth exports.

   China's commerce ministry said on Friday it is adding [69]16 U.S.
   entities to an export control list, banning them from acquiring Chinese
   products designated as dual-use, for civilian and military purposes.

   "These entities have behaved in a manner that may jeopardize China's
   national security and interests, and no export operator is allowed to
   violate the above-mentioned provisions," it said in a statement.

[72]What U.S. tariffs look like from a Chinese trade city

   The commerce ministry put [73]11 other U.S. companies on a so-called
   "unreliable entity" list, effectively blacklisting them. It accused the
   companies of "carrying out so-called military technology cooperation
   with Taiwan despite China's strong opposition". Beijing considers
   self-governed Taiwan a part of China.

   The commerce ministry also announced that it is imposing export
   controls on seven types of rare earth minerals. They include samarium
   (钐), gadolinium (钆), terbium (铽), dysprosium (镝), lutetium (镥),
   scandium (钪) and yttrium (钇).

   In addition, China's customs administration is suspending some farm
   product import qualifications for several American companies.

   In explaining its retaliatory tariffs, the finance ministry said the
   imposition of tariffs by the United States is "not in line with
   international trade rules, seriously undermines China's legitimate
   rights and interests, and is a typical unilateral bullying practice".

   The U.S. action "not only undermines the U.S. self-interest, but also
   jeopardizes the development of the global economy and the stabilization
   of production and supply chains," it said.
