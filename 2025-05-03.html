<h1>May 2nd, 2025: Stocks Soar Amid Trade Hopes and Strong Jobs Data, Buffett Succession Plan Unveiled</h1>

<p><b>US Stocks Rally:</b> On May 2, 2025, US stocks experienced a significant rally, marked by the S&P 500 achieving its longest winning streak in two decades â€“ nine consecutive days of gains. This bullish trend effectively erased losses incurred since April 2nd. This date is notably referred to as "Liberation Day" because on that day President Trump announced substantial reciprocal tariffs, initially unsettling investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite also participated in this upward momentum.</p>

<p><b>Jobs Report Boost:</b> A robust jobs report released on Friday provided additional tailwind to the market. The US economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing economists' expectations of 135,000. This strong employment data mitigated concerns about a potential economic slowdown fueled by ongoing trade tensions.</p>

<p><b>Trade War Developments:</b> The softening of President Trump's stance on the US-China trade war played a pivotal role in the market's resurgence. White House officials have been hinting at potential trade deals with other nations, including India, signaling a possible shift in trade strategy. Furthermore, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry indicated a willingness to engage in trade talks if the US were to consider rolling back tariffs, offering a glimmer of hope for a negotiated resolution.</p>

<p><b>Fed Rate Cut Expectations:</b> Amidst the positive economic data, traders adjusted their expectations regarding a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The strong jobs report prompted Barclays and Goldman Sachs to push back their forecasts for the first rate cut of the year from June to July. While inflation remains above the Fed's target of 2%, cooling inflation provides the Fed with more leeway to focus on its inflation mandate.</p>

<p><b>Big Tech Earnings:</b> The recent market rally was also supported by strong earnings reports from major technology companies. Investors are expressing confidence in the resilience of the tech sector, particularly regarding investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Meta's resilience despite global challenges and Microsoft's robust earnings underscored the continued demand for data centers for AI development. However, Amazon's shares experienced a slight dip due to mixed guidance for the year.</p>

<p><b>Historical Perspective:</b> This market recovery comes on the heels of significant volatility in April, largely attributed to President Trump's "Liberation Day" reciprocal tariffs. In a historical context, the S&P 500's nine-day winning streak is a rare occurrence, highlighting the strength of the recent rebound. If the S&P 500 closes higher again on Monday, it will be the first 10-day winning streak since the 1990s.</p>

<p><b>Policy Uncertainty:</b> While market sentiment has improved, "policy uncertainty" surrounding trade remains a key concern for investors. The long-term impact of tariffs on the US economy and corporate earnings remains unclear, and investors will closely monitor trade negotiations and future data releases. The market remains susceptible to swings based on developments in trade policy and potential shifts in the administration's approach.</p>

<p><b>Berkshire Hathaway Succession Plan:</b> In related news, Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, ended his 60th annual shareholder meeting by announcing that he was going to recommend Greg Abel as the next CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The transition could come as soon as the end of 2025, where Warren Buffett says, he would still stick around in decision-making capacities where he can add value, but the final vote will always come down to Greg.</p>
