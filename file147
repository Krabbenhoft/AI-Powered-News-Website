   ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

   Forty-five years ago this weekend, the band R.E.M. performed together
   for the first time. The group from Athens, Georgia, went on to become
   superstars and left a permanent mark on their hometown. Reporter
   Melanie Peeples takes us there.

   MELANIE PEEPLES: Let's just say you can get there from here. All it
   takes is the right frame of mind. You don't take a trip to Athens. You
   make a pilgrimage.

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "PILGRIMAGE")

   R E M: (Singing) Pilgrimage. Pilgrimage.

   PEEPLES: Get in your car and point it towards Athens. Now you're ready
   for some driving music.

   (SOUNDBITE OF R.E.M. SONG, "DRIVER 8")

   PEEPLES: The world outside blurs past you, fields dividing one by one.
   Take a break when you need to, Driver 8.

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DRIVER 8")

   R E M: (Singing) And the train conductor says take a break, Driver 8.
   Driver 8, take a break. We can reach our destination.

   PEEPLES: You have reached your destination.

   PAUL BUTCHART: We're standing here at the site of St. Mary's Episcopal
   Church.

   PEEPLES: Paul Butchart gives tours to people from all over the world
   who come here for one reason.

   BUTCHART: It was here, in 1980, that R.E.M. played their first show.

   PEEPLES: The church building is long gone, torn down to make way for
   condos. But the brick and stone steeple remains - a monument to where
   it all started. But if you really want to go back to the beginning...

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BEGIN THE BEGIN")

   R E M: (Singing) Begin the begin. Let's begin again.

   PEEPLES: ...You're going to go to downtown Athens, to the Wuxtry record
   store - not the main one, but the boxcar-sized building on the side.
   This is the exact space where Wuxtry employee Peter Buck met a customer
   named Michael Stipe, who kept coming back and buying cool records. They
   struck up a friendship and, in true Athens fashion, a band...

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE ONE I LOVE")

   R E M: (Singing) This one goes out to the one I love.

   PEEPLES: ...And seven years later, a big hit.

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE ONE I LOVE")

   R E M: (Singing) This one goes out to the one I left behind.

   NICK BONELL: This is the real deal.

   PEEPLES: Nick Bonell, who plays in his own band, has worked here a
   little over a year. And though it's been 14 years since R.E.M.
   disbanded, the fans keep turning up.

   BONELL: All kinds of people come to this store, asking questions about
   the history.

   PEEPLES: Nick offers to let you sit in the chair that might be the same
   stool Peter Buck sat on. But you're trying to be cool, so you decline.
   Besides, it's time for lunch.

   UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: You said you had squash casserole? Can I get
   squash casserole, and...

   PEEPLES: Southern specialties are on the menu at Weaver D's, where
   owner Dexter Weaver is likely to call you doll baby when you tell him
   what you want.

   DEXTER WEAVER: What kind of cake was that?

   PEEPLES: It don't matter. They're all good. Outside the little, green
   brick building is the sign with the restaurant's slogan - automatic for
   the people. R.E.M. liked it so much, they named an album after it. When
   Weaver - a tall, jolly man of 70 - tells the story, he says, we were
   nominated for album of the year, like he was on the album.

   WEAVER: I was. They got the title from me (laughter). So it's we
   (laughter).

   PEEPLES: R.E.M. even took Weaver up to New York for the Grammys. When
   he came back home, sacks of fan mail started rolling in. Those who
   couldn't travel here to eat ordered T-shirts.

   Half a mile away is maybe the most iconic R.E.M. landmark of them all,
   the Murmur Trestle, an old, wooden railroad bridge immortalized in a
   black-and-white, pure Southern gothic photo on the back cover of their
   1983 album. Today's bridge is a reconstruction, but it looks a lot like
   the old one. It spans a little creek in a lush, green ravine. Bring
   your album cover and take a photo with it.

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CUYAHOGA")

   R E M: (Singing) This is where we walked. This is where we swam. Take a
   picture here. Take a souvenir.

   PEEPLES: Happy birthday R.E.M. For NPR News, I'm Melanie Peeples in
   Athens, Georgia.

   (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CUYAHOGA")

   R E M: (Singing) River runs red over it. We knee-skinned it, you and
   me. We knee-skinned that river red. And we gathered up our friends,
   bank the quarry river, swim.
