Trump downplays the role of far-right activist in firings of NSC staff

   President Trump is downplaying reports that far-right activist Laura
   Loomer influenced National Security Council firings on Thursday.

   Trump confirmed that some number of people were fired but would not
   specify how many or why. "Always we'll let go (of) people â€” people that
   we don't like or people that we don't think can do the job or people
   that may have loyalties to somebody else," he told reporters on Air
   Force One Thursday night.

   Loomer addressed her role in the firings in a [63]post on X Thursday
   night.

   "You know how you know the NSC officials I reported to President Trump
   are disloyal people who have played a role in sabotaging Donald Trump?"
   adding that the fired officials were "being defended by" commentators
   on CNN and MSNBC.

   National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said the NSC would
   not comment on personnel matters.

   Trump said he had spoken with Loomer on Wednesday and said she made
   some hiring recommendations, but denied she had anything to do with the
   NSC firings. Trump said he listened to her recommendations, "like I do
   with everybody. I listen to everybody and then I make a decision."

   Loomer, who has had two failed Republican bids for Congress, is known
   for [64]promoting conspiracy theories as well as anti-immigrant and
   anti-Muslim views. She shared a video on X that claimed 9/11 was an
   "inside job" and mocked former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala
   Harris' Indian heritage.
   [65]Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth attends a tariff announcement in
   the Rose Garden on Wednesday. A Defense Department inspector general
   has announced he will review Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app
   to discuss a military attack on Yemen.

of Signal

   She has been banned by multiple social media platforms. She was
   reinstated on X, once it came under Elon Musk's ownership. She has more
   than 1.5 million followers on the platform now.

   Trump called Loomer a "patriot" and a "good person."

   The firings also follow scrutiny of the security practices of the
   administration. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz or a staffer
   inadvertently added Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a chat on
   the [68]messaging app Signal. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared
   information relating to airstrikes in Yemen in that chat.

   The Pentagon acting inspector general is now investigating, at the
   direction of members of Congress.

   President Trump has resisted calls to fire Waltz and Hegseth, and the
   White House says no classified information was shared.
