   The Trump administration is expected to announce a deal as soon as
   Friday to potentially resolve TikTok's legal uncertainty. One plan
   under consideration by the White House involves leasing the app's
   algorithm from Beijing-based owner ByteDance, according to a person
   directly involved in the talks who is not authorized to speak publicly.

   Under the plan, a new U.S. entity would be created led by software
   giant Oracle. ByteDance is expected to retain a minority stake.

[71]Exclusive: White House in talks to have Oracle and U.S. investors take
over TikTok

   The algorithm leasing proposal has been controversial in the White
   House, according to the source. There is debate among China hawks about
   whether the plan truly removes ByteDance from having operational
   control of the app. But the move could circumvent the need for China to
   approve the deal at a moment when the Trump administration has
   announced [72]a 34% tariff on Chinese goods.

nations

   Trump imposed a sell-by date of Saturday for the hugely popular video
   service.

   Ahead of the deadline, a flurry of new bidders have shown interest,
   including one led by tech giant Amazon, but negotiators in the White
   House say the offer is not being taken seriously.

   Oracle, which already provides TikTok with most of its backend
   technical support, would be tasked with supervising the new entity to
   ensure there are no backdoors for the Chinese government to access the
   data of millions of Americans. The person involved in the negotiations
   with TikTok said the safety of users' personal data, rather than the
   algorithm, has been the dominant focus of the talks.

   "I don't think the algorithm is as scary to people in Washington as it
   used to be. The bigger concern is data security," the person said last
   week, adding on Wednesday that, "it looks a whole lot like Project
   Texas 2.0."

   That is a reference to a plan that first took shape in Trump's first
   term in which Austin-based Oracle was tapped to be a custodian of
   TikTok's data, and would conduct regular audits of the app's algorithm.
   The plan, which stalled out without ever receiving final approval
   during the Biden administration, included a "kill switch" that would
   allow U.S. officials to shut down the platform if national security
   benchmarks were not satisfied.

   The new version of the Oracle-led arrangement involving leasing the
   algorithm, which was first reported by the Washington Post, does not
   include the kill switch option.

[78]Supreme Court upholds TikTok ban, threatening app's existence in the U.S.

   White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt would not comment on the
   Oracle plan, but told NPR in a statement that "if and when a TikTok
   deal is announced, it will come directly from President Trump."

   A deal would provide relief to TikTok in what has been a bumpy year.
   A[79] federal law took effect in January that bans the viral video app
   nationwide unless it splits from Beijing tech giant ByteDance.

   Congress passed the ban in 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support
   over national security fears that an app used by more than half of
   Americans should not be controlled by China, a foreign adversary of the
   U.S. TikTok fought the ban all the way to the Supreme Court, calling it
   a violation of free speech rights — but the court[80] upheld the law in
   early 2025.

   Starting the evening of Jan. 18, just before the ban was planned to
   take effect, the[81] app went dark for 14 hours. But it flickered back
   on the next day after Trump promised to sign an order delaying the ban
   once he was sworn into office.

   On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an[82] executive order pushing back
   the start of the ban by 75 days, and promising immunity for other tech
   companies that provide back end services for the app, such as Apple and
   Google, which host it in their appstores. That extension is set to
   expire on April 5.

   Legal experts say Trump's delays do not halt the ban, meaning it is
   still technically illegal for TikTok to operate in the U.S. with ties
   to China. Yet moves by Trump and his administration[86] assuring TikTok
   and its service providers that U.S. authorities will not prosecute
   anyone under the law have been enough for the popular app to stay
   online, despite operating in violation of a federal statute.

   Since January, Trump has said there has been "tremendous interest" from
   potential buyers of TikTok, an app used by more than 170 million
   Americans and a valuable asset for anyone who might want to influence a
   whole generation of young internet users who flock to the service every
   day.

   NPR[87] reported in January that cloud computing company Oracle has
   been tapped by the White House as a top contender to lead a coalition
   of other investors to acquire a sizable stake in TikTok's U.S.
   operation.

   Oracle is run by Larry Ellison, a billionaire Republican donor who has
   long been a close ally of Trump.
