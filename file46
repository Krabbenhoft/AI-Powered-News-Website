   Actor and political pundit Russell Brand is facing multiple charges of
   rape and sexual assault, London's Metropolitan Police announced on
   Friday, listing charges that span more than six years.

   The criminal charges were announced one and a half years after Brand
   was [63]accused of sexual misconduct by four women in the fall of 2023.

   Brand denied those allegations after they emerged, saying that while he
   had been sexually promiscuous, all of the interactions "were absolutely
   always consensual."

   But the women's accounts sparked a police inquiry.

   "The women who have made reports continue to receive support from
   specially trained officers," Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy said
   in a statement as [64]the charges were revealed.

   Brand has not been placed under arrest, the Met tells NPR. The agency
   says he was interviewed and then charged via "postal requisition" — a
   court summons informing him of the charges.

   He is set to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on May 2. NPR's
   attempts to reach Brand's representatives for a response to the charges
   were not returned before this story was published.

   Brand is charged with one count of rape, one count of indecent assault,
   one count of oral rape and two counts of sexual assault. The police
   allegations range from a 1999 rape in the Bournemouth area to a woman
   who was sexually assaulted in the Westminster area of London between
   2004 and 2005.

   The formal charges do not span the entire range of allegations
   previously reported by the press. Investigative reports by [65]The
   Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 had cited Brand's accusers who
   alleged abuse occurred from 2006 to 2013, with some of the alleged
   crimes taking place in the U.S.

   Brand, who has increasingly devoted his public appearances to boosting
   right-leaning political causes, appeared in a [66]lengthy interview
   with Fox News host Sean Hannity earlier this week. According to the
   outlet's summary, their discussion centered on Brand being baptized as
   a Christian last year and his battles with drug addiction.

   The allegations from the early 2000s cover a period in which Brand
   worked as a radio host for the BBC and MTV's U.K. outlet, as well as a
   touring comedian.

   Brand's career rose to a new level when he hosted the popular British
   TV show Big Brother's Big Mouth, a companion to the reality staple Big
   Brother. His growing popularity built more support for his comedy
   shows, and he released My Booky Wook — a book that was followed by
   several others.

   Brand has amplified conspiracy theories in recent years, including his
   embrace of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic
   — a time when Kennedy famously criticized the coronavirus vaccine. More
   recently, Brand has made videos advertising a "magical amulet" that can
   protect its wearer from malevolent energy.

   When abuse allegations arose in 2023, Brand's then-publisher paused its
   projects with him. But he has used platforms such as podcasting and
   videos on YouTube and the Rumble site to continue reaching his fans.

   Brand is 50 years old, according to police, citing records that list
   Feb. 4, 1975, as the actor and comedian's birthday. That clashes with
   media outlets that have long reported a June 4 birthday for Brand,
   which would make him 49.
