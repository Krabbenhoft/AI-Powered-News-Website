   ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

   Measles keep spreading in West Texas. More than 250 people are reported
   to have contracted the disease, and the actual number is likely a lot
   higher. The virus has spread across the border into New Mexico. Now,
   this outbreak is happening in remote rural areas, so the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk remains low and
   that vaccination is the key to prevention. Doctors say it's a good time
   to remember how dangerous and long lasting measles can be. NPR's Maria
   Godoy has more.

   MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Dr. Alex Cvijanovich has been a practicing
   pediatrician for more than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by
   the memory of a teenage boy she treated at the start of her career. The
   boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young to
   be vaccinated.

   ALEX CVIJANOVICH: He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood who
   was unvaccinated.

   GODOY: It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant
   recovered. He grew up to be a healthy, bright kid.

   CVIJANOVICH: He was an honors student and just a charming, delightful
   kid.

   GODOY: Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms.

   CVIJANOVICH: He started getting lost between classes - lost, like he
   couldn't find what class to go to next.

   GODOY: Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to
   figure out what was wrong until one finally suspected a condition
   called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE. It's a
   degenerative neurological condition that typically develops 7 to 10
   years after a measles infection. It's almost always fatal. Cvijanovich
   was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.

   CVIJANOVICH: The problem is that there is no treatment for it. And he
   basically became more and more incapacitated over time.

   GODOY: She says, some 18 months later, the teenager died. SSPE was once
   considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious
   disease specialist who wrote a history of measles, says data from
   outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several decades suggest that's not
   the case.

   ADAM RATNER: It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids
   under about age 2, it's much more common than we thought.

   GODOY: Perhaps as common as 1 in 5,000 cases - vaccination prevents not
   just SSPE but also other serious complications that measles can cause,
   like pneumonia and severe brain swelling. It can even erase your immune
   memory. Steven Elledge is a researcher at Harvard who studies how the
   immune system responds to pathogens.

   STEVEN ELLEDGE: Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune
   system has a memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past.

   GODOY: Your immune system holds onto those memories so the next time it
   encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can destroy
   the cells that retain those memories.

   ELLEDGE: And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to
   that particular pathogen. So the next time you get it, you've got to
   make - fight that battle all over again.

   GODOY: This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to
   some extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies
   widely.

   ELLEDGE: So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune
   memory. And the more severe your case of measles is, the - and the
   longer it lasts, the more of your immune system is destroyed.

   GODOY: Some research suggests it can take two to three years for the
   immune system to recover. Adam Ratner says, as vaccination rates fall,
   the U.S. is likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks.

   RATNER: There's no doubt that we will, in the future, see the long-term
   consequences of measles.

   GODOY: But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those
   consequences, vaccines. Maria Godoy, NPR News.
