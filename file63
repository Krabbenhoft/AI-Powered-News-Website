   Employees at National Endowment for the Humanities put on leave A
   majority of NEH employees received an email placing them on immediate
   leave. The news comes just days after many humanities councils across
   the country were told their grants would be terminated.

   Staff at the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) were told by
   email late Thursday night that they were being placed on paid
   administrative leave effective immediately. The news comes two days
   after 56 state and jurisdiction humanities councils across the country
   [64]received a letter that their NEH grants were being terminated.

   The NEH has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

   A senior NEH official, who requested anonymity because they were not
   authorized to speak to the press, confirms to NPR that among the 145
   staff members – 80% of the staff – placed on administrative leave are
   people from communications, program officers and directors. The
   official says a team from the Department of Government Efficiency has
   been visiting NEH offices over the past couple of weeks "and then
   ratcheted up the pressure."

   Earlier this week, DOGE had told NEH staff that it would lay off a
   substantial number of employees and cut its grant programs, as first
   [65]reported by The New York Times.

   Nearly half of the NEH's budget goes directly to humanities councils in
   every U.S. state and jurisdiction. The endowment also supports museums,
   libraries, preservation, history and media projects through a
   competitive application process.

   The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403 (AFGE), the
   union that represents many NEH employees, writes in a statement that it
   "condemns these damaging cuts to people and funding. The arbitrary and
   dismissive approach to employees and grantees is frankly un-American
   and unacceptable."

   Humanities councils are reeling from the news that millions of dollars
   in previously awarded federal grants have been canceled by the Trump
   administration. The letter they received this week stated grants were
   being terminated because the NEH is "repurposing its funding
   allocations in a new direction in furtherance of President Trump's
   agenda."

   Caroline Lowery, executive director of the [66]Oklahoma Humanities
   Council, said the impact will be "devastating." Among the projects it
   supports are oral histories from survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race
   Massacre and archiving material from the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

   "This will mean the erasure of our ability to preserve and share our
   history," Lowery told NPR. "We have broad bipartisan support for our
   work. This is not a partisan issue. These funds had already been
   congressionally mandated and signed into law by people who we elect to
   represent us."

   Christina Barr, executive director of Nevada Humanities writes in a
   statement, "The loss of funding from the NEH will not only severely
   hinder our work, it will also reduce the tremendous amount of economic
   activity that arts and culture programming brings to the state of
   Nevada."

   Employees at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) were
   also put on administrative [67]leave this week.

   Erin Harkey, CEO of American's for the Arts (AFTA) calls the actions
   against the IMLS and the NEH "an unprecedented threat to culture in
   America."

   Harkey echoed Barr's statement that eliminating funds to these agencies
   will hurt local economies in every corner of the country, pointing to
   recent study by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The
   [68]study found that the "arts and cultural sector grew at more than
   twice the rate of the total economy between 2022 and 2023."

   "Recent economic figures from the NEA highlight the significance of
   these institutions, which contribute $1.2 trillion to the U.S. economy
   and support 5.4 million jobs," writes Harkey. "Eliminating federal
   support for arts and humanities agencies will harm American families,
   weaken local economies, and undermine our nation's competitive edge."
