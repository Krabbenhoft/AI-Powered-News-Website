   Who to watch for in this weekend's Final Four games Cooper Flagg and
   Paige Bueckers, the presumptive top picks in this year's NBA and WNBA
   drafts, are on deck this weekend with hopes of a national title. But
   the star power doesn't stop with them.

   It's a top-heavy Final Four weekend for [69]the men's and [70]women's
   NCAA college basketball tournaments. And there's plenty of star power
   to go around, from future top draft picks and National Player of the
   Year candidates.

   defended by Mohamed Wague #5 of the Oklahoma Sooners during the first
   half in the first round of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at
   Lenovo Center on March 21, 2025 in Raleigh, North Carolina.

[72]Sports

[73]Where is the NCAA basketball tournament game-winning buzzer-beater?

   For only the [74]second time ever, all four No. 1 seeds have reached
   the Final Four in the men's tournament. And in the women's bracket,
   three of the original four top seeds will be joined by No. 2 UConn, a
   perennial contender led by [75]star Paige Bueckers.

   The women's Final Four begins Friday at 7 p.m. Eastern time with a
   matchup between Texas and the [76]defending champions, South Carolina.
   Afterward, UCLA and UConn will face off. The two winners will play for
   the title on Sunday at 3 p.m. Eastern time.

   On Saturday, the men's Final Four will have Florida and Auburn tip off
   shortly after 6 p.m. Eastern time, followed by Duke and Houston in the
   second game. The winners will advance to the national championship game
   on Monday night.

   The women's games will be broadcast by ESPN, and the men's games will
   be carried on CBS.

   Here are five big names to watch for:

Cooper Flagg, Duke forward

   At this point, you only need an introduction to Flagg if you're just
   tuning in to college basketball for the first time this season. He's
   the [77]true freshman phenom, a 6-foot-9 forward with endless energy
   who moves and shoots with rare agility and poise for a kid who started
   the season as a 17-year-old. He's the frontrunner for both National
   Player of the Year and top pick in the NBA draft.
   Cooper Flagg, a true freshman phenom for the Duke Blue Devils, has
   endless energy and moves and shoots with rare agility and poise for a
   kid who started the season as a 17-year-old. He has Duke two wins away
   from another national championship.

   A national title would be the only cherry left on top of Flagg's
   stellar season — and frankly, it's feeling more and more inevitable.
   This Duke squad is a powerhouse and has waltzed into the Final Four,
   including an impressive 20-point win over the high-flying Alabama
   Crimson Tide. Although they can't rest too easy just yet: Their next
   opponent, Houston, is the [78]best defensive team in the country,
   according to the stats site Kenpom.com.
   [79]Michigan State beat Ole Miss in the Sweet 16 round of March Madness
   on Friday in Atlanta. The sheer number of games to bet on in a short
   time makes the NCAA tournament popular with legal sportsbook games.

hard to find

   Also watch for fellow freshman Kon Knueppel, another top NBA prospect
   (and pride of Wisconsin) who is Duke's #2 scorer. He's stepped up big
   when Flagg has been out or playing poorly.

Paige Bueckers, UConn guard

   Is it finally the moment for Paige Bueckers?

   The hype around Bueckers was massive when she arrived in Storrs as a
   freshman in the fall of 2020, hot on the heels of UConn's streak of 12
   consecutive Final Four appearances. That first year, [82]she lived up
   to it, leading the Huskies back to the Final Four and earning herself
   AP and Naismith Player of the Year awards. But two knee injuries
   sidelined her for most or all of her sophomore and junior seasons. And
   then, last year, she and the Huskies were overshadowed by South
   Carolina and Iowa.

   After all that, Bueckers could have left for the WNBA. Instead, she
   returned to UConn with the hopes of bringing the Huskies their first
   title since 2016, a drought that was once impossible to imagine. She
   has been spectacular this season, with threes, assists and blocks to
   spare. (And [83]she spent March cooking breakfast for her Muslim
   teammate Jana El Alfy, who was fasting for Ramadan.)

   Also watch for freshman center Sarah Strong, who has come on, yes,
   strong over the course of her first year. She dominated during the
   Huskies' last game against No. 1 USC, in which she scored 22 points and
   grabbed 17 rebounds against just one personal foul in 40 minutes of
   play. You will be seeing her name much more in the years to come.

Johni Broome, Auburn forward

   The only competition for Flagg in the National Player of the Year
   discussion is Broome, the 6-foot-10 forward and SEC Player of the Year.

   His career is the opposite of Flagg's. As a high schooler, Broome
   wasn't hyped as a prospect and only got scholarship offers from a
   handful of mid-major schools. He began his career at Morehead State
   before transferring to Auburn in 2022. Now, in his fifth and final year
   of eligibility, he has emerged as one of the country's finest players.
   Broome has posted 21 double-doubles this season.

   A note of concern: Broome briefly left Auburn's Elite Eight victory
   over Michigan State with an elbow injury after he landed awkwardly from
   a defensive play. He returned to the game but has missed practices this
   week to recover.

Lauren Betts, UCLA center

   The 6-foot-7 junior is a tough matchup for any team — that's why she
   has averaged 20 points and 9.6 rebounds per game this year. Now, Betts
   has guided the [87]UCLA women's basketball team to the Bruins'
   [88]first-ever NCAA Final Four appearance. And she has saved her best
   for the biggest stage, with two double-doubles so far in the tournament
   plus a six-block defense-first performance against No. 3 LSU in the
   Elite 8.

   LSU limited Betts' offensive contributions by luring her into foul
   trouble early in the game, forcing her to sit out for the entire second
   quarter. But UCLA runs deep, with eight players who average at least 17
   minutes per game, and the rest of the Bruins held off LSU until their
   star could return. "I don't have to be in the game at all times. I have
   a team full of players who are just amazing and talented in their own
   right," Betts said afterward.

   Also watch for UCLA's playmaker guard Kiki Rice, who's averaging 13.5
   points and 7.3 assists in the NCAA tournament so far.

Walter Clayton Jr., Florida guard

   Top-to-bottom, Florida might be the most talented team in the country
   besides Duke. And they were a popular pick to win the tournament after
   they convincingly won the SEC conference tournament. Yet, for a moment
   last week, it looked like the Gators' NCAA run was over, when they
   trailed by nine points with only three minutes left to play in their
   Elite Eight matchup against Texas Tech.

   The Gators needed a hero, and it was Clayton who saved them. Twice he
   drew a double team then quickly passed the ball out to teammates for
   open three-pointers, then followed with two long balls of his own to
   put the Gators back on top with a minute to go. Clayton plays
   fearlessly, and no deficit is too big for him to stop pushing.

   "There's not another player in America you would rather have right now
   than Walter Clayton with the ball in his hands in a big-time moment,"
   said Florida coach Todd Golden after that game. "He's obviously a
   blessing to have in our program, to have on our team."
