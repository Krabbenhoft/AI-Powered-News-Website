   LEILA FADEL, HOST:

   Two-time Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez won the Nobel Peace
   Prize in 1987 for his role in promoting an end to the civil wars
   devastating Central America. He was president between 1986 and 1990 and
   again between 2006 and 2010, holding firm against President Ronald
   Reagan, who backed the right-wing Contra militias in their war against
   the government of Nicaragua. Arias, at 84 and a longtime supporter of
   democracy, has also been a vocal critic of President Trump's policies.
   I spoke with him through an interpreter, NPR's Obed Manuel, after Arias
   got the news that his U.S. visa was revoked.

   OSCAR ARIAS SANCHEZ: (Through interpreter) I received an email on
   Tuesday - it was a very short one - that said that my B1/B2 visa had
   been revoked. So what I did was I called the embassy to ask what had
   happened.

   FADEL: And what did they say?

   ARIAS: (Through interpreter) They asked me to come into the embassy.
   Fortunately, I live about five minutes away, so I was able to be there
   in person, where they somewhat explained what happened.

   FADEL: And what did they say?

   ARIAS: (Through interpreter) They told me my visa was revoked because
   of my close ties to China. During my second administration, from 2006
   to 2010, I established diplomatic relations with China, and that's
   because it has the second-largest economy in the world. Costa Rica has
   a very open economy, and its growth relies on international trade. And
   so, in 2007, is when we formally established diplomatic relations.

   FADEL: How much do you think your public statements criticizing
   President Trump - comparing him to a Roman emperor - played in them
   suspending your visa?

   ARIAS: (Through interpreter) I don't know. The embassy workers didn't
   say that was specifically why my visa was revoked, and they cited my
   relationship with China. But I have to imagine that my criticism of
   President Trump might have played a role. The president has a
   personality that is not open to criticism or disagreements.

   FADEL: The Trump administration says it's targeting anyone they deem as
   having what they define as a, quote, "hostile attitude," unquote, to
   the U.S. What do you make of that policy?

   ARIAS: (Through interpreter) I don't have a hostile attitude towards
   the United States.

   FADEL: At this point in our conversation, Arias switched from his
   native Spanish to English.

   ARIAS: Friends sometimes agree, sometimes disagree. And concerning U.S.
   policy towards Central America, supporting militarily the Contras
   affects my own country, Costa Rica. During the Reagan administration, I
   had a strong disagreement with his policy towards the region. But
   concerning my feelings towards the U.S., you know, my two children were
   educated in the U.S. My son went to Harvard, and my daughter went to
   Boston College. I received more or less 85 honorary degrees from the
   best universities in the U.S. I am a good friend, but I also have
   fought for noble causes.

   FADEL: I mean, what does it say, though? I think there's so much
   fascination with your case because you're such a known figure, and yet
   your visa was revoked. So what does that say about the policy of the
   U.S. today under this administration?

   ARIAS: Well, I don't agree with it. For a democrat - and I am a true
   democrat - criticism is welcome. It's the only way how you can build
   agreements. This happened to me when I met with the five Central
   American presidents in August of '87. I had introduced my peace plan.
   In the U.S., it was called the Arias Peace Plan. From a negotiation,
   you never get what you want. You always get what you can. And with
   criticism from adversaries or from the press and - freedom of the press
   and freedom of opinion and freedom of expression is a prerequisite for
   any democratic government, so I have benefited myself with criticism
   from all those sources. And it seems to me that nowadays, one shouldn't
   dare to criticize the U.S. because could be punished.

   FADEL: Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Costa Rican President
   Oscar Arias Sanchez. Thank you so much for your time.

   ARIAS: Thank you.

   FADEL: We asked the State Department about this case, and we got a
   statement saying it doesn't discuss the details of individual cases.
