<p><b>Stock Market Plunge Amidst Presidential Pressure on Federal Reserve:</b> The U.S. stock market experienced a significant downturn on Monday, April 21, 2025, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting over 1,000 points and the S&P 500 losing over 3%. This market slump is largely attributed to ongoing concerns about President Donald Trump's repeated public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and uncertainty surrounding global trade policies.</p>

<p><b>Trump's Attacks on Powell:</b>  President Trump has been publicly and repeatedly pressuring Fed Chair Powell to lower interest rates, even going so far as to suggest Powell's "termination" and labeling him a "major loser." These attacks on the Fed's independence have sparked worries among investors regarding the central bank's ability to independently formulate monetary policy.

Ongoing trade disputes with China and other countries only exacerbate these concerns, making it difficult for companies to plan for the future and for investors to assess the potential impact on their portfolios. Investors are particularly worried that tariff negotiations could last many months.</p>

<p><b>Dollar Weakens as Safe Haven Status Questioned:</b>  The U.S. dollar has slumped to a three-year low, a concerning sign as investors typically seek safe havens like the dollar during times of economic uncertainty. The dollar's weakness signals a potential loss of confidence in U.S. economic policy. This unusual combination of higher Treasury yields and a weaker dollar suggests that global investors are pulling capital out of the U.S. due to the current political and economic climate.</p>
