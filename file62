Stocks sink in another brutal day, as Trump's tariffs send global shockwaves

   Wall Street is not Main Street — but this week, investors and consumers
   alike seem terrified of how President Trump's tariffs could upend the
   global economy.
   [63]Since the 1960s, the U.S. has charged a 25% tariff on imported
   pickup trucks — which until this week was ten times the tax on imported
   cars. The extra protection from foreign competition encouraged U.S.
   automakers to concentrate on pickup trucks while largely ceding the
   market for cheaper, smaller vehicles.

[64]Economy

[65]The U.S. already has tariffs on a few sectors. It hasn't gone that great

   [66]Americans are worried by the impact of tariffs. Some are dialing
   back on their spending as a result.

[67]Business

[68]Tariffs are another reason why Americans feel so lousy about the economy

   The pain continued for U.S. stocks on Friday, a day after the stock
   market[69] suffered its worst day in five years.

   Late on Friday morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over
   1,400 points — or 3.4% . That extended its Thursday selloff of nearly
   1,700 points, or 4%.

   The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the benchmark S&P 500, which tracks the
   largest U.S. companies, also continued to tumble: Both fell more than
   4% on Friday morning.

   Trump shocked businesses, investors, and global trading partners on
   Wednesday, when he announced that his long-promised tariffs would
   affect almost all U.S. imports. He has imposed the taxes on U.S. allies
   and foes alike: Most U.S. imports will now face tariffs of at least 10
   percent, with higher taxes on goods from the European Union, Japan,
   China, and dozens of other countries.

   The global trade war [70]intensified on Friday. China responded to
   Trump's taxes with a reciprocal 34% tariff on all U.S. imports; other
   countries are also likely to retaliate.

Shock and anger

   Economists warn the new taxes will result in higher prices and slower
   growth in the United States — while spilling over into other countries
   and hurting the global economy.

   Investment bank JPMorgan on Thursday [71]warned that the tariffs are
   likely to push the U.S. and the world into a recession.

   [72]Businesses of all sizes reacted with [73]shock and anger as they
   processed the sweeping costs that they — and their customers — will now
   have to pay to continue doing business.

   [74]Consumer spending is already slowing down, while [75]consumer
   confidence has plummeted. And even a [76]reassuring jobs report on
   Friday morning — with employers adding more jobs than expected last
   month — couldn't quiet widespread market fears about the outlook for
   the post-tariffs economy.
