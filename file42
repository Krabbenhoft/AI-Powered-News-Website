Correction April 4, 2025

   While historical sources record Sen. Alfonse D’Amato's speech as 23
   hours and 30 minutes, the U.S. Senate Historical Office removed him
   from the list of longest speeches earlier this week. "Turns out D’Amato
   did not speak for 23 hours straight but had a long break when the
   Senate recessed in the early hours of the morning," wrote Daniel S.
   Holt, associate historian at the Senate Historical Office, in an email.
   Since this would not be known to the general public, we have left the
   correct answer as D'Amato.
