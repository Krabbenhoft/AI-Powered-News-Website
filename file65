   Accessibility Statement for NPR NPR's Accessibility Statement

Accessibility

   Updated April 22, 20245:57 PM ET Originally published November 16,
   20229:32 AM ET

   NPR's mission is to work in partnership with Member stations to create
   a more informed public â€“ one challenged and invigorated by a deeper
   understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures. To ensure
   that our content is accessible to all audiences, we have implemented
   practices and procedures to aid in the accessibility of our content and
   distribution platforms.

   NPR currently supports the accessibility of our content with:
     * Transcripts
     * Screen reader compatibility
     * Video captioning
     * Keyboard navigation
     * Skip links
     * Aria labels
     * Color contrast ratio testing

   Below are details about some of these efforts, and information about
   how we work with third parties.

Transcripts

   NPR aspires to make transcripts available for all NPR-produced
   broadcast shows and podcasts.

   The transcript button (pictured below right) appears on the right side
   of the audio player bar for story pages and podcast episode pages at
   [60]NPR.org.

   lengths in a circle.
   NPR

   For broadcast content, transcripts are typically published or linked
   directly on individual story pages at [61]NPR.org. For stories with
   multimedia content and digital companion reporting, you will find the
   transcript link as a button in the audio player bar. We publish
   transcripts as soon as they are available. Because the transcripts are
   reviewed for accuracy, they are not published at the same time as the
   audio.

   For podcasts, transcripts are available on individual[62] podcast
   episode pages by clicking the transcript button in the audio player
   bar. Please note that NPR platforms and products also include some
   podcasts produced by third parties, and NPR cannot guarantee
   transcripts for those podcasts. More detail is available in the section
   on third-party content below.

   NPR transcripts from 1990 to now are free in many public libraries.

   If you aren't able to find a specific transcript that you are looking
   for, please email [63]accessibility@npr.org for assistance.

Screen reader compatibility

   NPR works to ensure that our websites and applications are screen
   reader compatible and guided by the standards recommended by the Web
   Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We recommend using the most
   recent versions of web browsers and mobile applications for the best
   experience. If you encounter any issues, please email
   [64]accessibility@npr.org for assistance.

Video captioning

   Many NPR-produced editorial videos include captioning. For NPR-produced
   videos where captions are not currently offered, alternatives may be
   available. You can send a request to [65]accessibility@npr.org.
     __________________________________________________________________

Third-party content, distribution channels and venues

   NPR works with third parties in a variety of ways. In some cases, we
   distribute content that was produced by third parties and not by NPR.
   In other cases, third parties distribute NPR-produced content on
   platforms that are controlled by those third parties and not by NPR. We
   also host live events at venues across the country. While NPR works
   with third-party content creators, distribution channels, and venues to
   consider accessibility, NPR does not control how third parties operate.
   Certain features and experiences may be different than those usually
   provided by NPR. If you have questions or feedback about the
   accessibility of NPR content available through third parties, please
   email [66]accessibility@npr.org. Below is more information to help you
   understand how NPR works with third-party content providers,
   distributors, and venues:
     * Third-party content: NPR makes various types of third-party content
       available through its platforms, including: (i) content produced by
       NPR Member stations and other third-party public media
       organizations; (ii) content linked or embedded from third-party
       platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo; and (iii) content sourced
       from outside photo, audio, and video producers. In addition, NPR
       platforms may include links to content on third-party websites.
     * Third-party distribution: You may also find NPR content on various
       third-party distribution channels, including: (i) Member station
       websites, broadcasts, and digital platforms; and (ii) Commercial
       and social media platforms, such as third-party platforms where NPR
       content may be available, for example smart speakers, social media
       (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram), and in-car
       platforms.
     * Emergency alerting: NPR is working to help Member stations enable
       text emergency alerts to appear on smart car dashboards, smart
       speakers, mobile phones, and tablets that are synchronized with
       broadcast content. The alerts, which are produced by local
       stations, are designed to warn users in the event of natural or
       man-made disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, chemical spills,
       wildfires, and boil-water alerts.
     * Live event venues: NPR hosts live events at facilities across the
       country, and we work with event venues to ensure that the
       facilities and content are accessible for ticket holders. For
       information on accessible entry and seating, please contact the
       applicable venue. For questions about interpreters, content
       adaptation, or other accommodations, contact NPR directly at
       [67]nprpresents@npr.org.
     __________________________________________________________________

   We are continually working to ensure an inclusive experience for all
   audiences, wherever and however people engage with NPR content. We
   encourage you to check this page regularly for the latest information.
   If you have feedback or questions about accessibility features, please
   email [68]accessibility@npr.org.
