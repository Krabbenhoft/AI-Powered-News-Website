   Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at NPR At NPR, diversity is not a

Diversity In Action At NPR

   In our journalism, diversity means accurately and authentically
   reporting on the country and the world, which is only possible with the
   robust inclusion of the stories and voices of, about and by people who,
   because of the actions of individuals and systems, are so often
   under-covered, misrepresented or left out. Inclusion means embracing
   ideas that run counter to or outside of long-held notions and
   narratives created without the benefit of the diversity of people and
   perspectives we now seek.

   In our content, diversity means including people in their difference
   and in their ordinariness, mitigating the biases and prejudices that
   can warp coverage and distort truth. In hiring, we are striving to
   create a workforce that, at every level, looks more like America, even
   as we work to overcome a legacy of exclusion.

   Diversity means that we are doing the hard work of rooting out bigotry
   and bias in structures, systems and processes and replacing them with
   equity, empowerment, and fairness. It means that everyone is learning
   and growing, expanding their understanding of themselves and others and
   shedding the flawed and consequential views and practices that have
   made so much of this work necessary.

   At NPR, diversity is not a program or initiative. It is an inextricable
   part of our mission to serve the American public.
   [61]Our Ongoing Work Learn in depth about the new and continuing
   initiatives that NPR has established to better embody its values. These
   programs and policies strive to ensure that NPR is diverse, equitable,
   and inclusive, as a workplace and a public service institution.
   [62]Our Staff Diversity Each year, NPR publishes a report to reflect
   the most current data on our staff diversity. Our commitment to
   building an NPR that reflects, serves, and inspires America begins with
   our people, and we must be able to measure our progress.
   [63]Our Accessibility Statement To ensure that our content is
   accessible to all audiences, we have implemented practices and
   procedures to aid in the accessibility of our content and distribution
   platforms.
   [64]Our News Source Tracking Since 2013, NPR has tracked the
   demographics of sources appearing on our newsmagazine shows. Our
   newsroom mission statement says that we seek to "look and sound like
   America," and our source-tracking work is one way to hold ourselves
   accountable to that goal.
