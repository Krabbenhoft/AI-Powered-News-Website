   Jason Isbell says his latest album, Foxes in the Snow is about "growing
   and changing ... and not about accusing Amanda [Shires] or any other
   individual person of any wrongdoing." Christy Bush hide caption

   No matter how many love songs exist in the world, [77]Jason Isbell says
   there's always room for one more.

   "What I try to do is closely document my own experience, put my own ...
   fingerprint on these songs," the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter and
   guitarist says. "Everybody's looking at the moon, but we're all looking
   at it from a different spot."

   Isbell got his professional start with the [78]Drive-By Truckers, but
   parted ways with the band in 2007. He's since led the band the [79]400
   Unit, but his latest album, Foxes in the Snow, is a solo effort. It's
   been described as a divorce album, with songs about his 2024 break-up
   with fellow musician [80]Amanda Shires.

[83]The rebuilt heart of Jason Isbell

   "On first listen, you could dismiss this record and say, these lyrics
   are very simple compared to things that I've written in the past,"
   Isbell says. "What I was attempting to do is document a very specific
   time where I was going through a lot of changes really, really quickly.
   And I was in a lot of pain. I felt a lot of shame."

   Though some of the lyrics sound angry, he's not outwardly critical of
   Shires.

[86]Jason Isbell Locates His Musical Compass On 'Southeastern'

   "The record's about growing and changing as me, myself, and not about
   accusing Amanda or any other individual person of any wrongdoing," he
   says. "I don't think there's really any criticism at all. ... I think
   perspective, empathy for the other person starts to sink in as time
   passes."

Interview highlights

   On playing old love songs now, since the marriage ended

   Writing songs and watching how the meanings of those songs evolve over
   time, that's just art. I think it's that way for everybody who creates
   something that has emotional weight to them.

   Jason Isbell

   I can. I can also not [on] some nights, and that feels really good,
   too. Just because I feel like I can arrange a show that is satisfying
   for me and the audience without putting that one in there. ... The old
   songs, they mean different things to me now, because I have hindsight,
   and the emotions that I'm feeling now when I'm playing those songs,
   they're not the same as they were when I wrote them. They're certainly
   not that sort of obsession. There's more nostalgia for the person that
   I was when I felt that way. There's also a document of love that I had
   for someone, and I feel like that was reciprocated at the time. I mean
   that's just art. Our lives change. And the hard part for me is not
   writing about it — the hard part is making the decisions that lead me
   to peace. That's very, very difficult. But I'm not just going to whine
   for the rest of my life. ... Writing songs and watching how the
   meanings of those songs evolve over time, that's just art.

   On experiencing lingering thoughts about death during his break-up with
   Shires

[89]Amanda Shires examines the fault lines in her marriage on her new album

   I call it my "hillbilly brain," but it goes to the worst possible
   scenario in a lot of situations. I spend a lot of time thinking about
   death, not in a sad or fearful way, but in a way that, I think, well, I
   have already done so many things and got to see so many things and that
   might not have necessarily been in the plans for me at the beginning.
   So I'm very, very grateful for the time that I have had and I think the
   song deals with that, among other things.

   There was definitely a time early on after Amanda and I had split up,
   when I was driving in the car and the radio wasn't on and I was alone
   and I just heard myself say out loud … "Is this going to kill me?" And
   I didn't even know that I was thinking that question, but I heard it
   bounce off the windshield. … Everything is brief — so, so brief, but
   it's so beautiful.

   On his song "Bury Me"

   I had written a song about molting, a song about changing from one
   stage in your life to the next. And sometimes that's metaphorically
   characterized as death. But also, I remember that [91]Robbie Robertson
   album where there was a song where he talked about, "It Is a Good Day
   to Die," and that was chanted over and over and over and over. And I
   remember thinking, what a grateful way to feel. And I think "Bury Me"
   deals with rebirth and change but it also deals with gratitude, because
   it's like well, if I died today, then I've had a good time.

   On being asked to leave his band Drive-By Truckers, in 2007, for
   alcohol-induced bad behavior

   I went wild because I was postponing dealing with the trauma of my
   childhood, and at the time it was much easier to blame it on being in a
   rock and roll band, because it did feel like a gang, you know? It felt
   good. I felt like, alright, I'm in with these guys, they're older, they
   smoke cigarettes, they drink whiskey. … It motivated me not only to
   have more confidence but also it made me feel like I could push my own
   boundaries and test my own boundaries a little bit. But ... the truth
   of it was that I was just postponing growing into an adult, untangling
   those knots and making a deal with a community where I would treat them
   fairly and hope for the same in return.

   On reckoning with the trauma of his upbringing

   Growing up around so many deeply conservative, deeply religious people,
   I think that's trauma, in and of itself. I think a lot of people in
   America are dealing with that now because I think being deeply
   conservative and traditional in your values is child abuse. And I had
   to deal with it because I felt so much guilt and so much shame growing.
   I had to come to terms with myself, be able to sit with myself and
   think, you don't deserve to go to hell just for existing, no matter
   what anybody has told you. And your body, your feelings, those belong
   to you. Those are not to be judged by anyone else walking this Earth.
   Your behavior, your actions, fair game. But your feelings are your own,
   and it was traumatic for me to hear otherwise.

   On being sober for 13 years and writing "It Gets Easier," a song about
   sobriety

   You think it's hard to write a love song, try writing a damn recovery
   song and not sounding like a bumper sticker. That's very hard. But you
   gotta be personal, and you gotta be very small. … I worked hard on that
   song to make sure … that it scans right, that it sounds conversational,
   that it doesn't sound forced, like you're jamming syllables in where
   they don't belong. And if you can do that, you'll cut out a whole lot
   of your potential for cliché. ... You can use lyrics and phrases and
   subject matter that have been covered so many times in the past, but if
   you get it to sing just right, then people forget they're listening to
   a song at all.
