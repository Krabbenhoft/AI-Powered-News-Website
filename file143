Your Support Makes A Difference

   Each week, NPR and Member stations reach millions of people across the
   country through quality reporting, artistic exploration, and thoughtful
   commentary that connects us to our communities and the world we live
   in. This critical work is made possible by the contributions of
   individuals and institutions who believe in the mission — to create a
   more informed public — one challenged and invigorated by a deeper
   understanding and appreciation of events, ideas, and cultures.

Give to Your Member Station

   The work of NPR stations is central to the far-reaching impact of
   public radio. These independent non-profits are community institutions,
   providing listeners with important local news, information, and
   cultural programming. They are a unique and vital asset to the
   communities they serve.

   to share your name, contact information, or other information,
   including information about your donations to NPR, with Member
   stations, you can [61]contact us any time. For more information, please

   station through the NPR Services, your information may be collected
   directly by that Member station. In that case, the collection of your
   information is subject to that Member station's privacy policy.
