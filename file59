   10 grocery items likely to see higher prices due to tariffs A trip to
   the grocery or liquor store is about to become even more expensive,
   economists say. From seafood to olive oil, these items will likely cost
   more under President Trump's tariffs.

Higher prices are likely for these 10 grocery items when tariffs hit

   April 4, 202512:24 PM ET

   A trip to the grocery or liquor store is about to become even more
   expensive, economists say, following the latest round of [63]import
   tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday. Those tariffs —
   taxes paid by businesses on goods from abroad — come on the heels of a
   previous round aimed specifically at Canada, Mexico and China.
   [64]The rhetoric between China and the U.S. has been heating up.

[65]Asia

[66]Trade war escalates as China hits back with 34% tariffs on all U.S. goods

   Prices for items such as seafood, coffee, wine, nuts and cheese are all
   expected to rise. And if you're tempted to grab a candy bar while
   you're in the checkout line, you'll probably have to pay more for that
   as well.

   Food industry analyst Phil Lempert, also the editor of
   [67]supermarketguru.com, estimates that with the latest tariffs added
   onto the import taxes already imposed on grocery items from China,
   Canada and Mexico, "probably almost half of the products in a
   supermarket — about 40,000 products — will be affected by these
   tariffs, whether it's the entire product or just an ingredient."

   Joseph Balagtas, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue
   University, says food prices will also be affected by other factors
   related to tariffs, such as higher costs for fertilizer from Canada and
   a weaker U.S. dollar.

[69]Trump unveils 10% tariff on all imports and 'reciprocal' tariffs dozens
of economies

   "A main takeaway here is that the country-specific, food-specific
   tariffs will not tell the whole story," he says. "This is such a big
   change in policy that there will be broader implications."

   It's impossible yet to know how much the tariffs will affect prices,
   but with the 10% tariff for many countries and higher "reciprocal
   tariffs" on other nations, the [70]tariff rates by country could
   provide some clues.

   Here are 10 grocery items you might want to keep an eye on and their
   country of origin (with tariff rates in parentheses).

Seafood

   Top sources: Canada (25%), Chile (10%), India (26%), Indonesia (32%)
   and Vietnam (46%) are the largest suppliers, [71]according to the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture.

   tariffs.

[74]How much will tariffs raise prices? Trump's economists just revealed
their answer

   This category is likely to take a big hit because the U.S. [75]imports
   the vast majority of its seafood — up to 85% according to the National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — and several countries that
   supply fish and shellfish to the U.S. have been among the hardest hit
   by the tariffs.

Coffee

   Top sources: Brazil (10%) and Colombia (10%), according to [76]USDA.
   [77]A roaster holds coffee beans ready to be ground. The cost of raw,
   or green, coffee has soared following drought in top-grower Brazil.

[78]Business

[79]Coffee prices are higher than ever. Here's what it means for your cup

   The U.S. is the world's largest importer of coffee, with about 80% of
   U.S. roasted imports coming from Latin America. More than 60% comes
   from just two countries — Brazil and Colombia, USDA says.

Fruit

   Top sources: Mexico (25%), Canada (25%), Guatemala (10%), Costa Rica
   (10%) and Peru (10%)

   Mexico supplies 60% of U.S. fruits, such as avocados, strawberries,
   raspberries, blackberries and blueberries, according to Lempert. But
   Guatemala and Costa Rica are also leading exporters of bananas to the
   U.S. Guatemala also ships melons, plantains and papayas, according to
   [80]USDA, while Costa Rica [81]exports pineapples, avocados and
   mangoes.

   "These products don't have a long shelf life, and with the tariffs,
   we're going to face significant issues with both price and
   availability," Lempert says.

Alcohol

   Top sources for wine: the European Union — France, Italy and Spain
   (20%). New Zealand (10%) and Australia (10%), according to [82]USDA.

   Top sources for beer: Mexico (25%), the Netherlands and Ireland (both
   with the EU's 20% tariff), and Canada (25%)

[85]How Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum could hit you at the grocery
store

   If your favorite summer beverage is Modelo, Corona, Heineken or
   Guinness, you'll likely be paying more. [86]Tequila imports from Mexico
   have also seen a surge in recent years and will be affected by the
   tariffs.

   Lempert says the imported alcohol sector is likely "to be clobbered."
   He also notes that beer sold in cans is also going to get a double hit
   due to tariffs on China and other aluminum producers.

Beef

   Top sources: Canada (25%), Mexico (25%), New Zealand (10%) and
   Australia (10%), according to [87]USDA.

   Although 90% of beef consumed in the U.S. is domestically produced,
   tariffs will likely add to existing price pressures. The cost of ground
   beef for consumers, for example, is already at [88]historic highs and
   according to the [89]USDA, the U.S. cattle herd is the smallest it's
   been since 1951.

Rice

   Top sources: Thailand (36%) and India (26%), [90]according to USDA.

   Although most rice sold in the U.S. is domestically produced, nearly a
   third is imported, mainly jasmine rice from Thailand and basmati rice
   from India.

Cheese

   Top sources: Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands (all subject to
   20% EU tariff), according to [91]USDA.

   Parmigiano-Reggiano, brie and Gouda could also see price rises.

Nuts

   Top sources: Vietnam (46%), Côte d'Ivoire (21%), Brazil (10%), Thailand
   (36%), according to the [92]World Bank.

   Cashews, pecans and macadamia nuts are likely to see the largest price
   increases.

Chocolate

   Top source: Côte d'Ivoire (21%) and Ecuador (10%), according to
   [93]USDA.

   The Hershey Company, one of the largest U.S. importers of cocoa beans,
   [94]says it sources its supply from Brazil, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire,
   Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, Nigeria, Papua
   New Guinea and Peru.

   Sponsor Message

   NPR reached out to Hershey, which makes Reece's Peanut Butter Cups and
   Kit Kat bars, among others, to inquire about future price increases. A
   spokesman for Hershey, Todd Scott, said the company could not comment
   because it is in an earnings window.

   However, Lempert says the tariffs come on top of "[95]serious increases
   in cocoa beans for probably the past two or three years because of the
   weather and the political climate in … Africa."

Olive oil

   Top sources: European Union (20%), particularly Spain, Italy and
   Greece.

   "Olive oil prices have gone through the roof," Lempert says. "They're
   going to go even higher."
