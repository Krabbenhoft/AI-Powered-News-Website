   [71]The NCAA and its Power 5 conferences agreed this week to a legal
   settlement that could allow for schools to pay athletes directly.

[72]Sports

[73]What we know and what we don't about a historic settlement to pay college
athletes

   The NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament is down to its final
   four teams. The season ends Monday with the men's championship game.
   But the results of another contest Monday could bring major changes to
   college sports.

   A federal judge is set to hold a final-approval hearing on April 7 on a
   multi-billion dollar settlement in a lawsuit between college players
   and the NCAA. The proposed settlement has two main components: It would
   distribute some $2.75 billion to athletes who competed before July 2021
   when the NCAA first allowed athletes to earn money from their name,
   image and likeness (NIL) rights. The second part would establish
   framework for athlete compensation moving forward.

   The NCAA has fought and lost a number of lawsuits over paying student
   athletes. In 2021, the Supreme Court[74] sided with athletes in a
   groundbreaking case that opened the door for players to earn money off
   of their name, image and likeness rights.

   Collectively, the rulings have transformed college sports. Today,
   players can earn thousands or even millions of dollars each season,
   then transfer freely to new schools in search of a better deal.

   And the new agreement, known as the House settlement, would further
   change the landscape by allowing schools to pay players directly for
   the first time ever and it would empower the NCAA and its power
   conferences to have greater oversight over NIL deals.

   NCAA President Charlie Baker says he supports this settlement and that
   its infrastructure is a win for student athletes.

   "Most of the entities that are involved in the NIL, their primary
   interest is athletics. They don't really care very much about
   academics," Baker told Morning Edition. "Ninety-nine percent of those
   student athletes are not going to play professionally, and it's going
   to be really important that their academic opportunities are pursued.
   And I think putting the infrastructure in place that's associated with
   the settlement, that's a big win for student athletes."NPR's A Martinez
   and Baker talked about the NCAA's efforts to support student athletes
   and what gets lost in the discussion about them.

   This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Interview highlights

   A Martínez: Now, the NCAA has approved NIL deals. Four years ago, it
   approved them, but since then has lost almost every lawsuit aimed at
   regulating compensation. What do you think accounts for the NCAA's
   arguments in these cases not being winning ones?

   Charlie Baker: The vast majority of that took place before I got here,
   so I'm really not in a position to speak to it.

   Martínez: Do you feel that the NCAA is still in control of college
   athletics?

   Baker: I guess that depends upon how you want to define it. How would
   you like to define it? Well, what you and I are talking about right now
   represents maybe 10% of college sports.

   Martínez: But I guess what I'm asking is, do you think that the NCAA
   image has changed over the last few years in the eyes of college sports
   fans?

   Baker: I think the change was long overdue here, and I'm glad that
   since I got here about two years ago, we put a post-eligibility health
   insurance program in place for kids who were dealing with an injury
   that they sustained while they were playing their sport. I'm glad we
   finally have core guarantees in place with respect to scholarships, so
   that if a student athlete gets a scholarship, they keep it whether they
   play or not. I think all those are really important elements to
   creating the next generation in college sports.

   Martínez: The things you mentioned sound like common-sense decisions,
   but why do you think it has taken so long to get to these points where
   that is now something that is included, as opposed to maybe in the
   past, when it felt like the NCAA was a bit draconian in the way they
   viewed student athletes?

   Baker: Again, I can't really speak about the stuff that was taking
   place before I got here.

   Martínez: But you've watched NCAA sports. You've observed it over your
   years.

   Baker: I'm not trying to be cute here, but I had a day job, and it was
   a pretty big, complicated, and challenging job being governor of
   Massachusetts. My primary focus when I got here was to do a lot of
   things that I thought were important for the future of student
   athletes.

   Sponsor Message

   Martínez: So one last thing: what you just mentioned, student athletes.
   Are we still at a point where it is legitimate to call these athletes
   "student athletes"?

   Baker: I think the other thing that kind of gets lost in all this is
   the lessons the kids learn playing sports, the whole idea about what it
   means to be part of a team, and the requirement that in some cases, you
   put what you might want behind what's going to be in the best interest
   of the program or the team overall. It's a big part of why it's
   important, from my point of view, that we be aggressive and proactive
   about supporting student athletes.
