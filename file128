   The U.S. now has more than 600 measles cases in 22 states, according to
   [76]the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes 481
   cases in Texas alone. The country has now reported more than double the
   number of measles cases this year than were reported in all of 2024.

   The CDC says there have been six measles outbreaks so far this year.
   The largest by far is in West Texas, where the disease is spreading
   quickly in remote, rural areas where the vaccination rates are low. The
   outbreak has also spread across the border into New Mexico, but the
   outbreak there is moving more slowly due to higher vaccination rates.

   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk
   remains low and that [77]vaccination is the key to prevention.

   Still, doctors say it's a good time to remember how dangerous and
   long-lasting the health consequences of measles can be.

   Dr. [78]Alex Cvijanovich has been a practicing pediatrician for more
   than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by the memory of a teenage
   boy she treated at the start of her career in Utah.

   The boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young
   to be vaccinated. "He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood
   who was unvaccinated," says Cvijanovich, who now practices in New
   Mexico.

   It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant recovered. She
   says he grew up to be a healthy, bright kid — an honor student.

   Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms. "He
   started getting lost between classes, lost like he couldn't find what
   class to go to next," Cvijanovich says.

[81]As measles cases rise, a new book warns parents not to underestimate the
disease

   Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to figure
   out what was wrong, until a pediatric neurologist finally suspected a
   condition called [82]subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE. It's
   a degenerative neurological condition that typically develops seven to
   10 years after a measles infection. It is almost always fatal.
   Cvijanovich was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.

   "The problem is that there is no treatment for it," she says. "And he
   basically became more and more incapacitated over time."

   Some 18 months after his initial diagnosis, she says, the teenager
   died.

   SSPE was once considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric
   infectious disease specialist in New York City who wrote[83] a history
   of measles, says data from outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several
   decades suggests that may not always be the case.

   "It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids under about
   age 2, it's much more common than we thought," Ratner says.

   For example, a review of [84]measles cases in California found that,
   between 1988 and 1991, SSPE cases occurred as frequently as 1 in every
   1,367 cases in unvaccinated children under age 5. Another study that
   looked at U.S. outbreaks between 1989 and 1991 put the rate of SSPE at
   roughly [85]1 out of every 4,600 measles cases.

   Vaccination prevents not just SSPE, but also other serious
   complications that measles can cause — including pneumonia and severe
   brain swelling.

   And there's a common consequence from measles infection you might not
   know of: It can erase your immune memory.

   "Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune system has a
   memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past," says
   [86]Stephen Elledge, a professor in the genetics department at Harvard
   Medical School who studies how the immune system responds to pathogens.

   Elledge says your immune system holds on to those memories, so the next
   time it encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can
   destroy the cells that retain those memories.

   "And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to that
   particular pathogen," he says. "So the next time you get it, you've got
   to fight that battle all over again."

   This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to some
   extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies widely.

   "So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune memory. And
   the more severe your case of measles is, the longer it lasts, the more
   of your immune system is destroyed."

   In [87]one study, Elledge and his colleagues found that unvaccinated
   children had lost between 11% and 73% of their antibodies, which
   recognize and neutralize viruses and bacteria.

   Other research suggests it can take [88]two to three years for the
   immune system to recover. And in the meantime, kids might be left
   vulnerable to infection from other diseases, including ones they had
   previously been immune to.

   person might infect as many as 18 people).

[90]Public Health

[91]As the Texas outbreak grows, how contagious is measles, really?

   Researchers say immune amnesia helps explain one phenomenon that was
   documented after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s:
   Deaths from other childhood diseases [92]dropped dramatically. Even
   deaths from diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea were cut in half.

   Ratner says as routine childhood vaccination rates fall, the U.S. is
   likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks. "There's no doubt that
   we will in the future see the long-term consequences of measles," he
   says.

   But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those
   consequences — vaccines.
