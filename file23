   How to talk to kids about radicalization : Life Kit It's a horror to
   think your kid could be a victim in a violent act of racism, sexism or
   other radicalization. It's a whole different kind of fear to think they
   could be the perpetrator of that act.

   This story was originally published on June 28, 2022, and has been
   updated. It contains spoilers for the TV show Adolescence.

   When the British drama [86]Adolescence dropped on Netflix in March, the
   reaction from the parents in my group chats was seismic. Some worried
   about their own teen sons, and others, their ability to monitor their
   kids' online activity.

   The four-episode series follows Jamie, a baby-faced 13-year-old boy
   arrested for the murder of a female classmate. Viewers observe early
   that Jamie is guilty, having slid into the online quicksand of the
   "manosphere," a catchall phrase for a network of online communities
   populated by the aggressive misogynists we sometimes call incels.
   Peddling a deep sexism and a belief that men are treated unfairly by
   society, these groups, made up of influencers like Andrew Tate, at
   their worst promote violence and celebrate mass murder.

   Sponsor Message

   In the series, Jamie's well-meaning family is blown apart by the
   revelations, and it's clear they were unaware of the degree to which
   social media, internet culture and toxic masculinity influenced their
   son.

   Their struggle between fear and guilt lies at the heart of parenting in
   2025. How do we protect our children from radicalization in the opaque
   online spaces of "men's rights" activists and incels? How do we fight
   the [87]active recruitment of young white males through video gaming,
   social media and smartphones? And how on earth do we explain to our
   boys what's at stake without pushing them away?

   These concerns are not new. But as a mom of two boys, ages 11 and 14,
   it's a valuable opportunity to chat with them, and I'm relieved it's
   the result of a fictional TV series instead of an act of violence or
   domestic terrorism.

   In 2022, I interviewed [88]Christine Saxman, a consultant who talks to
   parents and teachers about radicalization among young people. The
   conversation followed a wave of anxiety after a rash of mass shootings
   by young men in Buffalo, N.Y., and El Paso, Texas, when my boys were in
   middle school.

   I called Saxman recently to ask about what she'd been hearing from
   parents who'd watched the show. "Well, I think for the parent
   community, it's the fear. Just the overwhelming fear of 'oh my gosh,
   how am I supposed to know and keep up with all of what young people are
   using online?' And I think the thing I always share is you can't know
   everything."

   Sponsor Message

   Saxman told me her advice from our previous interview held up, and
   reiterated the central message of communicating constantly and calmly
   with your kids about what they are seeing and experiencing online. And,
   she said, give yourself a bit of a break.

   "Take a deep breath," she says, "and just know that it's always
   evolving. You don't have to know everything they're doing. Just build
   the trust by having a conversation early."

   Here are some of Saxman's top tips from our Life Kit 2022 interview.

Learn the signs of radicalization

   It's really important to know when your kid might be falling down the
   rabbit hole. What are the signs you should be aware of?

   Saxman told me to really keep an eye out for the kinds of jokes your
   kids are reacting to and making. Be particularly aware if they are
   beginning to engage with humor that dehumanizes others, in particular
   gay, transphobic and sexist jokes. Disguised as humor, it gives people
   with racist agendas plausible deniability, because it's "just" a joke.

   "Joking around LGBT issues," Saxman says, "... is a very common entry
   point for many different conspiracy theories. So the jokes get worse
   and worse, and then the content gets worse and worse ... almost like a
   Venn diagram, if you can imagine — the ways in which they can use each
   of these different levers to pull you in. Because once they've
   normalized this kind of dialogue that it's OK to dehumanize gay people,
   it's OK to dehumanize women, that we believe that there's this Jewish
   cabal running things, that's the stepping stone to go deeper and
   deeper."
   [89]Here's how to rethink your relationship with social media

Media

   She also recommended having some idea of the shape this kind of
   seduction can take. Western States Center, an advocacy group that
   tracks extremism in Oregon and the West, has [92]a comprehensive
   toolkit that can help you identify the different stages radicalization
   can take, like, sharing jokes and memes to be "edgy," or even asserting
   conspiratorial beliefs in daily life.

Help your kids understand their own power

   They have to learn to ask the right questions, not just of the content
   they see, but of their friends. What helps, especially with older
   children, is encouraging them to recognize and develop their own
   agency.

   Sponsor Message

   Saxman suggests supportive phrases like, "I believe you're a critical
   thinker." Or "I know you like to ask questions." Then, she says, you're
   "co-creating and learning about things together."

   Building up my older son's belief in his own judgment has been a game
   changer for me — and he's been much more open about the iffy things he
   runs into on the web. Balancing trust with a healthy dose of skepticism
   is hard, but it has paid off in the short time I've been emphasizing
   it, and we've been talking a lot more.

Don't overreact! You need to keep that relationship open

   I ... am reactive. I love to react. But Saxman made the point that when
   you blow up in fear about something, teenagers are less likely to seek
   you out when they really need you. So I've started training myself to
   chill out and bring up issues from a place of curiosity rather than
   fear. There's that balance again – it's really scary out there, but I
   don't want to make the kids think they're up against something that's
   impossible to overcome.

[94]Parenting: Difficult Conversations

[95]What to say to kids when the news is scary

   As far as expressing my own fears about how they might get sucked in, I
   found that watching the 2020 documentary [96]The Social Dilemma with
   them was really helpful. It's not a perfect film (it is a tech-bro
   apology tour at its heart), but it explains how white boys in
   particular are targeted by algorithms, and emphasizes the importance of
   making their own choices about what to watch on Instagram and YouTube,
   not just taking the video that is served up to them next.

Communicate frequently with other parents

   This can be awkward. But you have to do it! Not every family has the
   same rules around screens and online content, especially those with
   multiple ages in the house. For instance, if your kid has a friend with
   unfettered YouTube access, and they're watching it every time they go
   over to their buddy's house, it's important for you to know that, and
   to know how the parents are communicating about it.

   Sponsor Message

   It might mean you have to reconcile different views about what's
   appropriate. But these are important conversations, Saxman says, so be
   open to learning more about why one parent's rules may differ from
   another. "Just be curious," she says. Ask questions about how they came
   to that decision, and what it means for their own relationship with
   their child.

   The more you talk about what other parents are seeing and talking about
   in their own house, the more you know about what your own kid is
   exposed to — and what they are reading, watching and playing. (And
   you'll get good tips if you can build those relationships! I learned
   about [97]The Social Dilemma as a teaching tool from another parent.)

Most of all, BE CURIOUS

   Hey kids – What are you doing on TikTok? What's good? What's funny?
   Here's someone I like! Oh, you think I'm old? OK, well who do you like?
   Who's your favorite YouTuber? What kind of stuff do you see? What makes
   you laugh?

   Normalize your interest in their online life. Play Mario Kart! Make
   them build you a house in Minecraft. Curiosity builds relationships.

   I'll leave you with this. When I asked Saxman if there was anything in
   her work that gave her hope, here's what she said: "They do
   self-monitor. They monitor each other. I believe in them. And so I want
   to create a container to continue to support that. And that's what I
   want to ask from other adults."

One last thing ...

   I want to emphasize that this Life Kit episode is mostly about
   prevention, and that all of this means nothing if you aren't raising
   kids [98]who are fluent in the [99]language of racism and antiracism.

   Here are a few resources:
     * Ibram X. Kendi's 2022 book, [100]How to Raise an Antiracist.
     * Here are some of [101]Kendi's book recommendations on helping your
       kids understand race.
     * Life Kit has an episode [102]on talking to white kids about race
       and one on [103]talking to young children about race.
