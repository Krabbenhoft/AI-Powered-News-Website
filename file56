   The jobs market remains solid. A tariff storm could upend it Employers
   added 228,000 jobs in March, showcasing a solid labor market. But
   uncertainty over tariffs and tepid consumer spending may weigh on job
   growth in the months to come.

The job market remains incredibly healthy — but the tariff storm could upend
things

   The American labor market just provided a bit of reassuring economic
   news at the end of a rocky week.

   U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March. That's about twice the
   number added the previous month, when revised figures show employers
   added 111,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1%
   in February, as 232,000 people joined or rejoined the workforce.

   Jobs were added in health care, hospitality and construction. Retailers
   also added jobs — partly as the result of people returning to work
   after a strike.

   A strong labor market has been a source of stability in recent years,
   as businesses and consumers battled high inflation. Rising wages have
   enabled people to keep spending, which has kept the overall economy
   humming along. Average wages in March were up 3.8% from a year ago.

But there are worries about the outlook

   Despite the positive labor report on Friday, there are rising concerns
   about the economy.

   The stock market suffered its [64]worst drop in five years on Thursday
   — and is headed for steep losses on Friday as well — after President
   Trump ordered steep new tariffs on most of the goods the U.S. imports.

   Spending growth has slowed this spring as [65]cautious shoppers wrestle
   with uncertainty over the economic outlook. Higher tariffs and a
   falling stock market could be a further drag in the months to come.

   Friday's jobs report also shows some of the effects of the
   administration's large-scale layoffs. The federal government cut 4,000
   jobs last month, and another 11,000 in February, according to the Labor
   Department's official tally. That's based on a survey conducted in the
   middle of the month, but overall job cuts in the federal government are
   significantly larger.

   Between February and March, the cost-cutting team led by Elon Musk has
   signaled cuts of more than 280,000 federal workers and contractors in
   27 agencies, according to a count kept by the outsourcing firm
   [66]Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

   "Job cut announcements were dominated last month by Department of
   Government Efficiency (DOGE) plans to eliminate positions in the
   federal government," said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at
   the firm. "It would have otherwise been a fairly quiet month for
   layoffs."

   Surveys of both [67]manufacturing and [68]service sector managers by
   the Institute for Supply Management this week also point to a shrinking
   demand for workers.
