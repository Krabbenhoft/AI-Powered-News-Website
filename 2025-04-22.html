<h1>Recent Market Turmoil and Economic Uncertainty</h1>

<p>
The global financial landscape is currently facing significant headwinds, primarily stemming from escalating trade tensions and uncertainty surrounding the independence of the US Federal Reserve. 
The week began with a steep sell-off in US stock markets on Monday, April 21, 2025, as President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. This triggered widespread investor anxiety about the Fed's autonomy and future monetary policy decisions. All three major US stock indexes experienced substantial declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all tumbling more than 2%. This marked the fourth consecutive losing session for the Dow and Nasdaq, indicating a growing sense of unease among investors. This negative sentiment spilled over to other markets globally.

<b>The Federal Reserve and Political Pressure:</b> The core of the concern lies in President Trump's repeated public attacks on Jerome Powell. Trump has persistently accused Powell of keeping interest rates too high and warned that the economy could slow down unless the Fed lowers rates immediately. In his latest social media post, he labeled Powell "Mr. Too Late" and a "major loser". These remarks have raised serious questions about the political independence of the Federal Reserve, a cornerstone of the US financial system. Historically, the Fed has operated autonomously to ensure that monetary policy decisions are based on economic data rather than political considerations. Any perceived erosion of this independence could undermine confidence in the US dollar and US asset markets. Trump's persistent criticism has prompted speculation about whether he might attempt to remove Powell from his position. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration is "studying" the possibility of firing Powell, further fueling market anxieties. Legal experts are divided on whether the president has the authority to terminate the Fed chair due to policy differences, but the uncertainty surrounding the situation is adding to investor jitters.

<b>Tariff Uncertainty and Trade Wars:</b> Adding to the market's woes is the ongoing trade war, particularly between the United States and China.  Trump's initial announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs has sent shockwaves through financial markets. The major indexes have all tumbled more than 9% since the initial announcement of tariffs. Recent reports indicate that trade talks between the US and Japan have stalled, suggesting that the negotiations over tariffs might last for many months, adding another layer of worry to global trade stability. Recent statements from Beijing have warned companies against striking deals with the US. Analysts warn this action could raise the chance of a recession. Specifically, 3M anticipates potential 2025 earnings reductions of up to 40 cents per share due to rising tariffs. In the current environment, investor focus is being directed at first quarter 2025 earnings as they carefully analyze predictions for the year amid all the uncertainties of trade.

<b>Market Reactions:</b> The market's response to the combined pressures of Fed independence concerns and trade wars has been significant.  On April 21st alone, the Dow dropped 950 points in one day due to President Trump’s renewed call for lower interest rates and contention with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tech and Consumer Discretionary stocks declined the most as Tesla high-growth tech stocks sold off.

Gold is soaring. Spot gold reached a new record high above $3,400 on Monday amid the uncertainty of the market.  Gold is up more than 30% year to date.

Notably, the US dollar has also weakened considerably, falling to its lowest level in three years against a basket of major currencies. The sliding dollar can be attributed to fears over the Fed’s independence and lack of progress in trade deals, a potential sign of waning confidence in the US.

Conversely, investors are starting to invest more heavily in equity funds. As of the week of April 16, tariff fears saw outflows in US market assets, as investors poured money into European equity funds.
