   Sean Combs, the entertainment mogul who's been [64]in custody since his
   [65]September arrest for charges including sex trafficking and
   racketeering conspiracy, faces two new counts as part of a superseding
   indictment filed in federal court on Thursday. The new charges expand
   the timeline of Combs' alleged crimes and could potentially result in a
   longer prison sentence.

   The first new count alleges that Combs engaged in sex trafficking by
   force, fraud or coercion between 2021 and 2024. The second alleges that
   within that same time period, Combs also transported multiple
   individuals — including an unnamed victim — "on multiple occasions with
   the intent that they engage in prostitution." Combs had already been
   indicted on counts of sex trafficking and transporting to engage in
   prostitution spanning from 2009 to 2018.

   NPR reached out to the lead attorney for Combs and Combs Global, Marc
   Agnifilo, for comment on the new charges and is awaiting comment. In
   the past, Combs' representatives have denied all allegations against
   him; he has pleaded not guilty to two prior indictments.

   The new indictment filed in the U.S. District Court - Southern District
   of New York still includes one count of racketeering conspiracy
   alleging that between 2004 and 2024, Combs Enterprises — including
   media, music, fashion and alcohol spirits companies — functioned as a
   criminal organization that facilitated and concealed Combs' alleged
   crimes. These include "a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse
   toward women and other individuals," including verbal, physical,
   emotional and sexual abuse that extended to his own employees. The
   charges allege that Combs Enterprises' activities violated U.S.
   racketeering laws through kidnapping, arson, bribery, forced labor and
   more.

   Jury selection for [66]Combs' trial is set to begin on May 5, with
   opening statements scheduled for May 12. In addition to federal
   charges, Combs faces more than [67]two dozen civil lawsuits for sexual
   assault, rape, sex trafficking and more.
