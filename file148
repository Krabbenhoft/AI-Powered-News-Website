   LEILA FADEL, HOST:

   The owners of TikTok have until Saturday to sell the app.

   MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

   Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a law banning the app, citing
   national security concerns unless it sheds its China-based owner,
   ByteDance. Following his inauguration, President Trump said he would
   not enforce the ban, which was still the law, and that he'd hold a
   public auction to sell TikTok over the coming months. Many bidders have
   lined up, including one from a YouTuber known as MrBeast, and a
   separate offer from Amazon.

   FADEL: But leading the pack is software company Oracle, according to
   NPR's Bobby Allyn, who joins me now. Good morning, Bobby.

   BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning.

   FADEL: So why is Oracle's offer the Trump administration's preferred
   plan?

   ALLYN: Yeah, for several reasons. First, Oracle already operates almost
   all of TikTok's cloud. So Oracle systems are, you know, already
   supporting the app. Secondly, Oracle has experience with high-level
   national security data. For instance, Oracle does cloud computer work
   for parts of the government, including the CIA. And finally, Oracle is
   run by billionaire Trump supporter Larry Ellison, and he has been
   setting the stage, Leila, for this deal for years by warming up to
   Trump, by defending Trump. Ellison even hammered out this deal that
   we're talking about right now, which involves leasing TikTok's
   algorithm from its current owner, the Chinese company ByteDance.

   FADEL: Leasing an algorithm. Is that even a thing?

   ALLYN: No, it's not really a thing, to be honest. It's extremely
   unusual. But a source close to the negotiations explain the logic
   behind it this way - a new U.S. entity would be created, led by Oracle,
   that can oversee TikTok. OK, and this new entity would lease TikTok's
   algorithm from ByteDance. That would get around having to have the
   Chinese government sign off on the selling of the algorithm, which has
   always been an open question as to whether Beijing would approve that
   or not.

   FADEL: But I don't understand that, because I thought the whole idea of
   the TikTok ban was to split TikTok from China. Would this plan do that?

   ALLYN: It depends on how you see that, right? It's been a very divisive
   thing in the White House, which is full of China hawks. And this is the
   big question - whether leasing the TikTok algorithm would mean China
   does not control it. This gets to why Congress passed a law, forcing
   TikTok and China to break up in the first place, as you've mentioned.
   And lawmakers of both parties remain concerned that China will use
   TikTok to influence Americans to steal their data. Trump is hoping this
   deal, though, will put those fears to rest, but there is no guarantee.

   FADEL: OK, so is there a timeline when this all might happen?

   ALLYN: Yeah, Trump has set this Saturday as the deadline for when
   TikTok needs to be sold. Most are expecting a deal to be announced
   sometime before then. The question becomes, how is China going to
   respond? Under the Oracle deal under consideration in the White House,
   they're making a concession to ByteDance by allowing ByteDance to keep
   a minority stake in the company. It's worth noting that, you know,
   Trump's stiff tariffs on Chinese imports are part of the TikTok
   conversation. Chinese authorities, I think, were hoping TikTok could be
   used as leverage to get a better deal on tariffs, meaning, you know, if
   China supported a TikTok deal, maybe they would get some relief on
   tariffs. But it doesn't quite look like that is what happened.

   FADEL: So you're telling me that MrBeast doesn't have a chance?

   ALLYN: No, MrBeast doesn't have a chance. It's really sad. I know.

   FADEL: (Laughter) MrBeast. All right, thanks, Bobby.

   ALLYN: Thanks, Leila.
