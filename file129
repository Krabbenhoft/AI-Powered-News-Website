5 things to know as Dr. Oz prepares to lead Medicare and Medicaid

   A version of this story ran on 3/25/2025. It has been updated to
   reflect Dr. Mehmet Oz's confirmation by the full Senate on 4/3/2025.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dr. Mehmet Oz, once the star of the long-running TV program "The Dr. Oz
   Show," won his bid to run Medicare and Medicaid Thursday. The full
   Senate confirmed him, 53 to 45 in a party line vote.

   Oz becomes the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
   Services or CMS, which is part of the Department of Health and Human
   Services. CMS runs Medicare, Healthcare.gov, and Medicaid, which is the
   joint state and federal health insurance program for low-income people.
   Altogether, it provides health coverage for nearly half the country.

   Here are five things to know about Oz and the job he's up for.

1. Like Trump and RFK, Jr., being a celebrity is part of his career path.

   Oz's first career was as a cardiothoracic surgeon at Columbia
   University. He is [72]remembered by colleagues there as a hard-worker
   who seemed to never sleep and cared about his patients.

   nameplate reading, "Dr. Oz."

[75]Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump's pick to lead Medicare and Medicaid, gets his
Senate hearing

   In the early 2000s, he began writing health books and going on
   television, and he eventually launched "The Dr. Oz Show" which ran for
   years. Oz got into some [76]hot water for products he promoted on the
   show, especially weight loss products, and in 2015, ten doctors called
   for his dismissal from the university. (He was not dismissed, and his
   [77]affiliation with the university continued for nearly a decade.) In
   2021, he announced his move into politics with a Senate run as the
   Republican candidate in Pennsylvania — a race he narrowly lost.

2. The future of Medicaid is up in the air.

   Unlike many previous administrators, Oz didn't work in health policy,
   but he does have experience treating patients on Medicare and Medicaid
   as a physician. During his hearing, he said the Columbia medical school
   is in an area of New York City "heavily populated by Medicaid patients,
   and I saw firsthand how our services [and] our health care system
   underserved these communities."
   [78]House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, center,
   flanked by Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the ranking member, left, and
   Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., right. House Republicans voted to seek at
   least $880 billion in spending cuts on programs overseen by the House
   Energy and Commerce Committee, which includes Medicaid.

[79]Policy-ish

[80]Republican proposals to cut Medicaid could be politically fraught

   He seemed sympathetic to the [81]Republican idea that Medicaid should
   be exclusively for the population it was originally designed to serve,
   including pregnant women and people with disabilities. Since 2014, the
   Affordable Care Act enabled [82]states to offer Medicaid to all
   low-income people, not just particular populations, and the program has
   grown.

   Now, congressional Republicans are looking to drastically shrink
   Medicaid to pay for President Trump's tax cuts. The House GOP budget
   outline asks the committee overseeing CMS [83]to find $880 billion in
   cuts, which would likely come from Medicaid.

   Sponsor Message

   Pressed for his position on these cuts by Democrats in his confirmation
   hearing, Oz was noncommittal, saying, "I cherish Medicaid," and that,
   to protect the program, it has to be "viable at every level."

   "He dodged, he weaved, he simply wouldn't answer," Ranking Member Ron
   Wyden, D.-Ore., said in the Finance Committee hearing on Tuesday, March
   25.

   Democrats on the committee slammed Oz for not committing to fight cuts
   to Medicaid. "I'm voting no because of what I see as a concerted effort
   by the Trump administration and some congressional Republicans to use
   Medicaid as an ATM to pay for tax breaks for the biggest, most
   successful corporations and wealthy individuals," Sen. Tina Smith,
   D.-Minn., said.

   Sen. Roger Marshall, R.-Kan., who is also a physician, responded by
   defending Republican plans. "Republicans are here to save Medicaid," he
   said, saying the program has gotten too big and too expensive and was
   unsustainable. "We want to strengthen Medicaid for the most
   vulnerable."

3. Oz's plans for Medicare are fuzzy.

   Even with Republican lawmakers looking for cuts, the future of Medicare
   is more secure than Medicaid.

   Still, the program is in flux as more and more seniors opt for the
   privatized version of it called Medicare Advantage, which allows
   beneficiaries to choose private insurance plans that the government
   pays for, over traditional, government-run Medicare.

   Oz has filmed [84]promotional videos about Medicare Advantage plans
   that are still up on his YouTube page, and are not clearly marked as
   ads. He also co-authored an [85]opinion piece in 2020 arguing that
   "Medicare Advantage for All" could provide universal coverage for
   everyone, not just seniors, and "save our health-care system." His
   financial disclosures also show he owned as much as $600,000 in stock
   in UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest Medicare Advantage insurers,
   although he said he would divest that interest if confirmed.

[88]Older Americans say they feel trapped in Medicare Advantage plans

   Critics of the program, which essentially privatizes Medicare, point to
   insurance companies [89]cherry-picking enrollees who are younger and
   healthier and [90]overcharging the program for treatment.

   During the confirmation hearing on March 14, Oz acknowledged some of
   these criticisms. "We're actually apparently paying more for Medicare
   Advantage than we're paying for regular Medicare — so it's upside
   down," Oz said. He cited [91]a report from the nonpartisan Medicare
   Payment Advisory Commission, which found that the federal government
   "will pay $83 billion more for [Medicare Advantage] enrollees in 2024
   than if those beneficiaries had instead been in [traditional
   Medicare]."

   Sponsor Message

   At the Finance Committee vote on March 25, Sen. Marshall called
   Medicare Advantage a "very broken system" and called for a bipartisan
   effort to reform it. Ranking Member Wyden had a different view. "Given
   Dr. Oz's history of basically acting as a salesman for Medicare
   Advantage, putting him in charge of regulating these middlemen is
   almost like letting the fox guard the proverbial henhouse," Wyden said.

4. He thinks being healthy is a "patriotic duty."

   Towards the end of his Senate hearing, Oz answered a question from Sen.
   Todd Young, R.-Ind., about how a healthier American population could
   help with high health care costs.

   "I think it is our patriotic duty to be healthy," Oz said. It feels
   better, it's the right thing for your family, he added, "but it also
   costs a lot of money to take care of sick people who are sick because
   of lifestyle choices."

   At another point during the hearing he told the senators: "For anyone
   in this committee who was able to go running or exercising for 20
   minutes yesterday, you probably did the equivalent of reducing $100
   billion of expenses for Medicare and Medicaid just by being active — if
   Americans would do that every day, that's what we'd experience."

   He also floated the idea of using federal guidance to incentivize
   patients to make healthy choices, such as instructing Medicare
   Advantage enrollees on how to use their benefits for nutritious food.
   This position fits in nicely with the "Make America Healthy Again"
   slogan of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
   who will be Oz's boss.

   Some commentators characterized these statements as tone deaf, given
   Oz's wealth and privilege. "There is no recognition that being able to
   afford groceries, let alone have time to cook them, is a prerequisite
   for achieving his version of 'eating healthy,' " [92]wrote author
   Virginia Sole-Smith.

5. His charm offensive did not yield Democratic votes.

   In his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Oz bantered easily with
   senators on both sides of the aisle, about potato chips with committee
   Chair Mike Crapo of Idaho and playing basketball with Ranking Member
   Wyden. (The hearing was much friendlier than the hearings for Secretary
   Kennedy, who was [93]skewered by Democratic senators for his past
   controversial statements and views, although he was ultimately
   [94]narrowly confirmed.)

   Still, that friendliness did not translate to bipartisan support in the
   Finance Committee, which voted 14 to 13. All Republicans on the
   committee voted for him; all Democrats voted against him. The pattern
   held when the full Senate considered his nomination on Thursday: 53
   Republicans voted for him and all Democrats voted against him.

Correction March 25, 2025

   A previous version of this story incorrectly said House Republicans
   want the committee that oversees the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
   Services to find $880 million in cuts. They want $880 billion in cuts.
