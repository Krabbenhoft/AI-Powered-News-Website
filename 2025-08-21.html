    <h1>Thursday, August 21, 2025: Market Volatility and Key Economic Updates</h1>

    <p>
        Thursday, August 21, 2025, saw a continuation of recent market volatility, driven by persistent inflation concerns, upcoming economic commentary, and sector-specific pressures. Several key factors contributed to the day's financial landscape.
    </p>

    <h2>Equity Market Performance</h2>
    <p>
        The S&P 500 marked its fifth consecutive losing day. This decline is largely attributed to investor apprehension ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Powell's remarks are highly anticipated as traders seek insights into the Federal Reserve's future interest rate policies, particularly concerning the ongoing battle against inflation. Federal funds futures indicate a significant expectation (approximately 74% likelihood) of the central bank initiating rate cuts at its upcoming meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a drop of approximately 150 points, reflecting broader market unease. Technology stocks, in particular, faced significant selling pressure throughout the week, contributing to overall market headwinds. The Nasdaq composite index also closed lower. The pullback in tech stocks serves as a reminder to investors for remaining balanced in their portfolio
    </p>

    <h2>Federal Reserve and Interest Rate Outlook</h2>
    <p>
        The focus remains sharply on Jerome Powell's upcoming speech. Market participants are keenly awaiting any signals regarding potential interest rate adjustments. Expectations are high that Powell will hint at a September rate cut, a sentiment that is already embedded in market pricing. However, some analysts caution that any deviation from this expectation could trigger a market correction, especially given the traditionally lighter trading volumes in August.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, released previously, indicated general support for maintaining current interest rates, with dissenting opinions from governors like Waller and Bowman. These discussions occurred before the release of the latest jobs report, further complicating the interest rate outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cleveland Fed President Hammack added to the rate uncertainty, stating that she does not see a case for a September rate cut, further fueling the trepidation.

    <h2>Sector-Specific News</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cruise Industry:</b> Citi reiterated its buy rating for Carnival Corporation, identifying it as its top pick in the cruise sector. Citi anticipates significant benefits from Carnival's new Celebration Key destination. The firm believes that Carnival is on track to achieve an investment-grade rating, which would then allow it to focus on share repurchases and dividends.  Shares of Carnival are up 17% year to date.</li>
        <li><b>Grocery Delivery:</b> Wedbush downgraded Maplebear (Instacart), citing increased competition in the grocery delivery space, particularly from Amazon's expanded same-day delivery service.  Amazon's same-day delivery service in more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. That announcement sent shares more than 11% lower earlier this month, and Devitt believes that the move has led to Prime becoming an "even more compelling subscription for grocery shoppers, diminishing the appeal of Instacart."</li>
        <li><b>Solar Energy:</b> Solar energy stocks declined sharply following President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. will not approve new solar or wind power projects. Trump's decision is aimed at preventing the destruction of farmlands and centralizing the renewable energy permitting process in Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's office, a move that has heightened concerns within the renewable energy sector.</li>
        <li><b>Beauty Retail:</b> Coty shares experienced a significant drop after the company forecast a weak first half for fiscal year 2026, with anticipated declines in both sales and profit. However, Coty anticipates a turnaround in the second half, driven by new product launches and tariff mitigation efforts.</li>
        <li><b>Technology</b> The technology sector has been weak this week, UBS has advised its clients to diversify and maintain a more balanced exposure, given that the AI rally is also maturing.</li>

    </p>

Additionally, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index for August indicated unexpected weakness, with fewer firms reporting growth than contraction. These economic indicators paint a mixed picture of the current economic environment.

    <h2>Individual Stock Movements</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Walmart:</b> Shares of Walmart declined following a mixed earnings report. While the retailer raised its full-year earnings and sales outlook, concerns remain about rising costs due to higher tariffs.</li>

CEO Xiaopeng He purchased 3,100,000 Class A ordinary shares through Galaxy Dynasty Limited, a security filing dated Thursday revealed.

        <li><b>Paramount Skydance:</b> Paramount Skydance shares rose following an unexpected profit in its streaming division.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Geopolitical Factors</h2>
    <p>
        President Trump's administration continues to implement its trade and energy policies, impacting various sectors. The administration spelled out new tariffs for autos and pharmaceuticals under a framework agreed upon with the European Union. Additionally, Trump's stance against renewable energy projects is reshaping the energy landscape, prioritizing traditional energy sources and centralizing permitting processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has been under pressure to resign due to unsubstantiated accusations of "mortgage fraud" by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, however Lisa Cook has said that she has "no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet."
    </p>
    <h2>Global Markets</h2>
    <p>
        Asia-Pacific markets generally rose, with Australian stocks breaking the 9,000 threshold for the first time. This performance contrasted with declines in key Wall Street peers. India's HSBC Composite flash purchasing managers' index showed robust growth.
