<h1>August 21, 2025: Market Volatility Amid Rate Cut Uncertainty and Tariff Concerns</h1>

<p><b>Stock Market Performance:</b> The U.S. stock market is exhibiting volatility as investors grapple with rising bond yields, mixed economic data, and uncertainty surrounding future Federal Reserve policy. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both lower, reflecting concerns about a potential pullback after a recent summer rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a midday rebound but ultimately trimmed gains.</p>

<h2>Key Factors Influencing the Market</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Federal Reserve Policy:</b> Investors are keenly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. There is considerable debate about whether the Fed will implement a rate cut in September. Market expectations for a rate cut have been tempered by recent comments from Fed officials, including Cleveland Fed President Hammack, who stated she does not see a case for a September rate cut.</li>
    <li><b>Economic Data:</b> Mixed economic signals are adding to market uncertainty. Weekly jobless claims have risen, suggesting a possible slowdown in hiring, while manufacturing and service sectors are showing growth, according to US flash PMIs.</li>
    <li><b>Inflation Concerns:</b> Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are raising concerns about potential inflationary pressures. Walmart, a major retailer, reported earnings that missed expectations, citing "tariff-related cost pressures." CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs are increasing costs weekly and impacting consumer shopping habits, especially among lower- and middle-income households. Historically, tariffs have been a tool used by governments to protect domestic industries, but they can also lead to higher prices for consumers and retaliatory measures from other countries, impacting global trade.</li>
    <li><b>Geopolitical Factors:</b> European markets are reacting to the implications of new US-EU trade agreements, with concerns about potential impacts on various sectors. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine also influences market sentiment, with developments such as potential ceasefire hopes affecting defense stocks.</li>
    <li><b>Sector Performance:</b> Healthcare is outperforming other sectors, demonstrating relative strength. Energy is also trading higher. On the other hand, Consumer Staples and Discretionary sectors are underperforming. Homebuilders are experiencing weakness as interest rates climb.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specific Company News</h2>

    <li><b>Walmart (WMT):</b> Shares are slumping after the company reported earnings that missed profit expectations. The company cited "tariff-related cost pressures" as a significant factor.</li>
    <li><b>Xpeng (XPEV):</b> Contrasting Walmart's woes, Xpeng, a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, is seeing positive stock movement following recent insider purchases of its A shares by Galaxy Dynasty Limited, underscoring confidence in Xpengâ€™s strategy following better-than-expected Q2 revenue.</li>
    <li><b>Cracker Barrel:</b> Is seeing public backlash from unveiling a new logo as part of wider rebrand efforts</li>
