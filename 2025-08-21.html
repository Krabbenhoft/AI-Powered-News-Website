    <h1>August 21, 2025: Stock Market Awaits Powell Speech Amidst Economic Uncertainty and Sector Shifts</h1>

    <p>
        The stock market is experiencing volatility as investors brace themselves for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
        The S&P 500 is currently on its fifth consecutive losing day, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 150 points.
        Investors are hoping Powell will provide clarity on the future path of interest rates, especially in light of persistent inflation concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>Interest Rate Outlook and Market Sentiment</h2>

    <p>
        Market sentiment is mixed regarding the likelihood of a rate cut at the Federal Reserve's next meeting.
        As of today, Fed funds futures are pricing in nearly a 74% probability of a rate cut.
        However, recent signals suggest that Fed officials are not entirely convinced a rate cut is imminent.
        This divergence in expectations is contributing to market jitters.
        Some analysts believe that the stock market is overvalued heading into the Jackson Hole symposium, and that investors are overly optimistic that Powell will hint at a September rate cut.
        Any indication to the contrary could lead to investors reducing their exposure, particularly given the lighter trading volumes typically observed in August.
    </p>

    <h2>Sector Performance and Notable Stock Movements</h2>

    <p>
        The technology sector has been under pressure this week, with heavy selling observed in tech stocks.
        UBS advises investors to maintain a balanced portfolio, noting that the AI rally, which has fueled much of the tech sector's growth, is maturing and becoming more prone to volatility.
        Specifically, UBS suggests managing exposure to both high and low AI sensitivity segments.
        Retail giant Walmart shares slumped on Thursday after missing profit expectations, although its revenue and sales outlook remained positive.
        The company cited rising costs due to tariffs as a contributing factor to the profit miss.
        In contrast, Zoom Communications saw its stock price surge after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by robust demand for its AI tools.

        Several stocks are making significant moves:
        Coty shares plunged following a weak forecast for the first half of fiscal year 2026.
        Paramount Skydance showed gains as its streaming division saw an unexpected profit earlier this month.
        Xpeng shares jumped after CEO Xiaopeng He purchased a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares.

    <h2>Economic Indicators and Policy Considerations</h2>

        In July, home sales rose, but analysts believe that prices are approaching an inflection point.

        President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would no longer approve solar or wind power projects, potentially impacting renewable energy companies.

        On the monetary policy front, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has stated she would not resign from her position despite recent criticism and unsubstantiated accusations of mortgage fraud from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

    <p>
        Investors remain focused on Powell's speech on Friday, hoping for insights into the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy decisions.
