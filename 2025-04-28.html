    <h1>April 28, 2025: Market Volatility Amid Trade Tensions and Big Tech Earnings</h1>

    <p>
        The stock market began the week of April 28, 2025, with a downward turn, influenced by a confluence of factors including ongoing trade tensions, the anticipation of significant earnings reports from major technology companies, and the release of key economic data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both experienced declines. This development follows a rally in the previous week spurred by President Trump's softened stance on tariffs and a perceived easing of threats to the Federal Reserve's independence.

        <b>Trade War Concerns:</b> A significant influence on market sentiment continues to be the trade war, particularly between the United States and China. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs, including proposed 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, has created uncertainty and negatively impacted business outlooks. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that de-escalation is "up to China," although he acknowledged the recent exemptions of certain US goods from Chinese duties as a positive step. The unpredictability of trade policy is causing havoc on supply lines and capital spending plans for many businesses as noted in the Dallas Fed's survey of manufacturing activity, which fell to its lowest level since May 2020. Executives across various industries expressed concerns about forecasting accuracy and committing to growth initiatives amid tariff and trade uncertainty.

        <b>Big Tech Earnings and Economic Data:</b> Investors are closely monitoring earnings reports from major technology companies, with 180 S&P 500 companies scheduled to release quarterly financial results this week. Additionally, macroeconomic data releases, such as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge and the initial reading on first-quarter US GDP, are expected to influence market direction. The labor market's resilience amid signs of economic slowdown is also a key point of interest, with the April jobs report on the horizon.

        <b>Specific Stock Movements:</b> Nvidia's stock is facing downward pressure due to reports that Chinese tech giant Huawei is developing a new advanced AI chip, circumventing President Trump's export ban on Nvidia chips to China. Tesla shares also declined significantly after a substantial gain last week. Domino's stock experienced a fall following the release of first-quarter earnings and a surprise decline in same-store sales, attributed to a consumer spending pullback amid macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation.

        <b>Tariff Impact on Businesses:</b>  The impact of tariffs goes beyond the tech sector. In the computer and electric manufacturing industry, an executive noted the inability to predict anything accurately due to tariff and trade uncertainty leading to refused shipments and delays. The food manufacturing industry is suffering similarly as supply lines are being negatively affected, and capital spending plans changed. Farmers are also stating they are in a full-blown crisis. Even Gold is being impacted as easing trade tensions cooled haven demand, causing the price to drop more than 5%

    <p>
        <b>Analysts' Perspectives:</b> Some analysts maintain a bearish outlook despite recent market rallies, citing missing conditions for a sustained stock market rebound. Bank of America strategists have encouraged investors to sell into the recent rebound in US equities and the dollar.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Historical Context:</b> President Trump's first 100 days in office have been some of the worst since President Nixon, driven by trade war.
