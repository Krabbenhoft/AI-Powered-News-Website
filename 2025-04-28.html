<h1>US Stock Market Faces Uncertainty Amid Trade Negotiations and Big Tech Earnings</h1>

<p>The U.S. stock market experienced a mixed trading day on Monday, April 28, 2025, as investors grappled with ongoing trade negotiations and looked ahead to a busy week of earnings reports from major technology companies. While the S&P 500 managed to eke out a fifth consecutive day of gains, the Nasdaq closed lower, highlighting the market's divided sentiment. This comes at the end of a volatile month for stocks, influenced heavily by President Trump's shifting tariff policies. The market is struggling to break through key resistance levels, hovering more than 10% below its 52-week high reached in late February.

<h2>Trade Deal Progress and Uncertainty</h2>

<p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered limited insights into the potential for a trade agreement with China. While acknowledging some progress on other trade proposals, like a potential deal with India, Bessent emphasized that it was up to China to de-escalate trade tensions due to the significant trade imbalance between the two countries. The ongoing tariffs, which Bessent described as "unsustainable," remain a major concern for businesses and investors. The comments followed rebuttals regarding whether or not trade talks between the two nations were actively ongoing. The Treasury Secretary asserted that they were, but China had announced otherwise.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Wealth Management cautioned against optimism surrounding potential trade deals, arguing that large U.S. companies might seek individual deals with the White House, leading to a "patchwork" of policies that could dampen investor sentiment. The firm also expressed concern about the credit market, highlighting a surge in the 10-year U.S. Treasury term premium and investor worries about stagflation and debt sustainability following recent tax cuts. They estimate the U.S. debt ceiling will require a substantial increase in the coming years.

<p>UBS offered a more optimistic outlook, predicting that a series of trade deals could materialize before President Trump's tariff reprieve deadline in July. They believe that Trump's most extreme tariff rhetoric is unlikely to be the final outcome, and that the White House is eager to demonstrate "success," leading to various deals and sector carve-outs.

<h2>Recession Fears Intensify</h2>

<p>The Apollo Global Management presented a timeline of the potential economic impacts of the Trump tariffs that showed the potential for shelves in US stores being empty in weeks, that a recession can be triggered in 6 months, and that by 12 months there would be a full blown depression. This potential for empty shelves in stores is reminiscent of the shortages consumers experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Earnings and Market Tone</h2>

<p>Deutsche Bank emphasized the importance of upcoming earnings reports from the "Mag 7" mega-cap technology companies, scheduled to release results later in the week. Their performance will be pivotal for the market's tone during the week, influencing investor sentiment and overall market direction.

<h2>Economic Data and Labor Market Reports</h2>

<p>This week will also feature important economic data releases, including the nonfarm payrolls report, first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), and the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. These reports will provide further insight into the state of the U.S. economy and could impact the Fed's monetary policy decisions.

<h2>Individual Stock Movements</h2>

<p>Several stocks experienced significant movement on Monday, including:

<ul>
<li><b>Boeing:</b> Upgraded by Bernstein, citing an improved growth outlook following recent scrutiny.
<li><b>Domino's Pizza:</b> Shares fell after the company reported mixed quarterly results, with revenue missing expectations despite better-than-expected earnings.
<li><b>Plug Power:</b> Shares plummeted after announcing a deal to issue up to $525 million in secured debentures.
<li><b>Nvidia:</b> Faced pressure following a report that Huawei Technologies is testing a new AI processor, potentially rivaling Nvidia's products.
</ul>

<p>Additionally, three stocks, including Chesnot, reached new 52-week highs, indicating continued strength in certain sectors.</p>

<p>Wolfe Research cautioned that the previous week's stock rally was more likely a sign of a bear market than a true turnaround, urging investors to prepare for further volatility. They noted that the market is hypersensitive to economic releases and trade deal news, leading to potentially violent upside rips as investors react to the latest data points.
