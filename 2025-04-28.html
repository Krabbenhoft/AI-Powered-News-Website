    <title>April 28, 2025: Market Turmoil Amid Earnings and Trade War Uncertainty</title>
</head>

<h1>April 28, 2025: Stock Futures Waver as Investors Brace for Key Earnings, Economic Data, and Trade War Developments</h1>

<p>Stock futures are exhibiting little movement on Monday, April 28, 2025, as investors cautiously anticipate a data-heavy week filled with first-quarter earnings reports and significant economic releases. Market sentiment remains fragile, largely influenced by persistent uncertainties surrounding international trade, particularly between the United States and China.</p>

<h2>Earnings Season in Full Swing</h2>
<p>This week marks the peak of the first-quarter earnings season, with over 180 companies in the S&P 500 index scheduled to announce their financial results. Among these are four of the 'Magnificent Seven' technology giants, whose performance will significantly sway market direction. Early earnings reports have been generally positive, with approximately 73% of reporting companies exceeding analysts' expectations. However, this figure is slightly below the five-year average of 77%, according to FactSet data, indicating a potential moderation in corporate performance.</p>

<p>Guidance from companies regarding future performance is being closely scrutinized, especially in the context of ongoing trade tensions stemming from President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Companies are struggling to provide clear forecasts due to the unpredictable nature and potential long-term impact of these tariffs, adding to investor anxiety. Any indication of weakening demand or squeezed profit margins due to tariffs will likely be met with negative market reaction.</p>

<h2>Trade War Developments</h2>
<p>Investors are keenly observing any developments in trade negotiations, primarily those between the U.S. and China. Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Mnuchin confirmed that communication lines remain open between the two countries, with President Trump having spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping. This follows a period of conflicting signals, with China initially denying ongoing discussions. The progress, or lack thereof, in these negotiations will be a crucial factor influencing market movements this week.</p>

<p>The ongoing trade dispute has a complex historical backdrop. Trump's administration initially unveiled sweeping tariff plans, then later softened some of the duties, causing significant market volatility. This back-and-forth policy has kept investors on edge, making it difficult to gauge the true economic impact and to formulate long-term investment strategies. The implementation of tariffs is rooted in Trump's long-held belief that the U.S. has been disadvantaged in trade agreements, especially with China, leading to substantial trade deficits and loss of American jobs.</p>

<h2>Economic Data on the Horizon</h2>
<p>The economic calendar this week includes several critical reports on the labor market, inflation, and overall economic growth. Friday's nonfarm payrolls release will be closely watched for indications of employment trends. Economists anticipate that the U.S. economy added 133,000 nonfarm payroll jobs last month. The release of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, as well as the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, on Wednesday, will further illuminate the state of the U.S. economy.</p>

<h2>Market Performance and Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>The stock market has experienced a volatile April, characterized by wide trading ranges triggered by Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent revisions. The S&P 500 index entered a bear market on April 7 but has since recovered somewhat, albeit failing to decisively break through key resistance levels. This indicates a lack of strong bullish momentum, with investors remaining cautious about committing to further gains.</p>

<p>Analysts are weighing in with various technical perspectives. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, notes that while it may be premature to declare a definitive bottom in beta underperformance, the recent rebound off key support suggests that investors should be vigilant for a potential shift back toward a 'risk-on' environment. This means that investors might be looking for opportunities to invest in higher-growth, more volatile assets if economic data and trade negotiations offer positive surprises.</p>

<h2>Company Specific News</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Bernstein Upgrades Boeing (BA):</b> Bernstein upgraded shares of Boeing, citing an improved growth outlook.  Analyst Douglas Harned increased the rating to outperform and raised the price target to $218 per share, stating that Boeing is making progress towards its pre-January 2024 growth trajectory before the Alaska door plug accident. The "Alaska door plug accident" refers to an incident where a door plug detached from a Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft during an Alaska Airlines flight in January 2024. This led to increased scrutiny and investigations into Boeing's manufacturing processes.
    <li><b>Domino's (DPZ) Shares Fall After Earnings:</b> Domino's shares declined after the pizza chain reported mixed first-quarter results.  Revenue missed Wall Street expectations, while earnings came in better than expected. U.S. same-store sales also declined, a worrying sign indicating that the company is facing a consumer spending pullback as macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation lead to slowing traffic. The company's new loyalty program, set to be launched in May, is expected to provide a boost to sales, especially in rural and suburban areas.
