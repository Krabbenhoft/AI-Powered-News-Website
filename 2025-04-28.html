<title>Market Volatility Continues Amid Trade Uncertainty and Tech Earnings</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Market Volatility and Key Developments on April 28, 2025</h1>

<p>
The stock market is experiencing mixed signals as traders carefully monitor Big Tech earnings, progress on trade negotiations, and emerging economic data. 
The S&P 500 exhibited minimal change, reflecting investor hesitancy amid ongoing uncertainties. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key events shaping the market landscape:
</p>

<h2>Trade War Developments and U.S.-China Relations</h2>

<p>
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent offered cautious remarks regarding trade negotiations with China, emphasizing that the responsibility for de-escalation lies with Beijing. 
He pointed out the trade imbalance, stating China's exports to the U.S. far outweigh U.S. exports to China, making current tariff levels unsustainable. These comments follow President Trump's prior statements suggesting a lack of trade talks between the two nations.
However, Bessent offered a glimmer of hope by mentioning progress on trade proposals with other countries, hinting that a deal with India could be imminent.
</p>

<p>
Some analysts, like Barclays economist Jonathan Millar, suggest a potential easing of U.S.-China trade tensions, citing adjustments to tariff rates. 
Despite these indications, skepticism remains about whether trade discussions can gain enough momentum to prevent a U.S. recession, which echos the situation in 1974 when President Nixon's resignation cast a shadow over the market.
</p>

<h2>Earnings Season Underway</h2>

<p>
Investors are keenly awaiting the peak of the first-quarter earnings season, with over 180 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 
The performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech giants will be particularly crucial. Initial earnings results have been relatively strong, with about 73% of companies exceeding analysts' estimates. 
This figure is, however, slightly below the five-year average of 77%, indicating a potential dampening effect from President Trump's tariffs. 
Companies are providing uncertain guidance due to the tariff-induced volatility.
</p>

<h2>Economic Data and Market Performance</h2>

<p>
April has been a tumultuous month for stocks, characterized by wide trading ranges as the market reacts to Trump's tariff policies. 
While there has been some recovery from the initial shock, the S&P 500 has struggled to surpass key resistance levels. This week will bring a flurry of economic reports, including labor market data, inflation figures, and economic growth metrics. Friday's nonfarm payrolls release and Wednesday's first-quarter GDP figures will be closely watched.
</p>

<h2>Hard vs. Soft Data</h2>

<p>
JPMorgan notes a divergence between "hard" and "soft" economic data. Hard data, such as labor market reports and GDP, has remained relatively resilient. In contrast, soft data, which includes sentiment indicators like consumer confidence, has shown signs of weakness. This divergence could be due to companies frontloading activity before tariffs take effect. However, JPMorgan warns that prolonged tariff uncertainty could eventually negatively impact hard data as well.
</p>

<h2>Early Market Movement</h2>

<p>
Stocks opened in the green on Monday morning, though gains remained tentative.
</p>

<h2>Stock Spotlight: Boeing and Domino's</h2>

<p>
Boeing shares are rising after Bernstein upgraded the stock to "outperform," citing an improved growth outlook following scrutiny from the Alaska Airlines incident in January 2024, in which a door plug came loose mid-flight. The analyst believes Boeing is making the necessary progress for future growth.
On the other hand, Domino's shares are falling after reporting mixed quarterly results. While earnings exceeded expectations, revenue fell short, and U.S. same-store sales also disappointed.
</p>

<h2>Nvidia and Huawei</h2>
<p>
Nvidia stock is under pressure following reports that Huawei is developing a new advanced AI chip, the Ascend 910D, aimed at competing with Nvidia's H100 chips. This comes after the U.S. government effectively banned exports of Nvidia's H20 chips to China to comply with tighter trade rules, potentially impacting Nvidia's revenue.
</p>

<h2>Overall Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>
Recent data suggests the stock market's first 100 days under President Trump's administration have resulted in damage with the S&P 500 index down approximately 8%, on track for its worst run during a presidentâ€™s first 100 days since Gerald Ford in 1974.
