[115]Why so many tornadoes hit tornado alley

   [116]April 2, 2025  Each year, the United States has about 1,200
   tornadoes. Many of them happen in tornado alley, a very broad swath of
   the U.S. that shifts seasonally. This area gets at least ten times more
   tornadoes than the rest of the world. Science writer Sushmita Pathak
   says that huge difference can be chalked up to one word: geography. But
   there's a slice of South America with similar geographical features
   that gets comparatively fewer tornadoes, so what gives? Sushmita wades
   into the research weeds with guest host Berly McCoy, one of Short
   Wave's producers.
