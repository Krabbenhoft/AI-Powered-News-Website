<body>

<h1>Stock Market News: Rally Continues Despite Trade War Concerns, Fed Rate Cut Expectations Wavering</h1>

<p>The U.S. stock market continued its rally for a third consecutive day on Thursday, April 24, 2025, driven primarily by gains in the technology sector. However, underlying economic anxieties persist, particularly concerning President Trump's ongoing trade war with China and the potential impact on corporate earnings and economic growth. Investors are also closely watching the Federal Reserve for signals regarding future interest rate policy.</p>

<h2>Market Performance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The <b>Nasdaq</b> led the gains, climbing over 2%, fueled by strong performance from major technology companies. The <b>S&P 500</b> and <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> also experienced positive momentum.</li>
    <li>The market rally initially sparked by hopes of easing trade tensions with China, faced a setback when China denied engaging in any deal talks with Washington. This underscores the persistent volatility and uncertainty surrounding the trade negotiations.</li>
    <li>Despite the official denial from Chinaâ€™s Ministry of Commerce, investors initially maintained optimism based on reports that the U.S. was considering slashing tariffs on Chinese goods. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Mnuchin later tempered these expectations, clarifying that any potential tariff adjustments would be contingent on significant concessions from China.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trade War Impacts and Corporate Reactions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The ongoing trade war continues to cast a shadow over corporate earnings, with several companies adjusting their forecasts due to uncertainty. <b>American Airlines</b> withdrew its full-year guidance, citing an unclear economic outlook. Similarly, <b>PepsiCo</b> cut its guidance due to the potential impact of tariffs.</li>
    <li><b>Procter & Gamble (P&G)</b> lowered its profit forecast, revealing that U.S. shoppers had slowed their spending in February and March, citing tariff-related recession concerns. This indicates a tangible impact of the trade war on consumer behavior.</li>
    <li>In contrast, <b>Whirlpool</b> has declared itself a "net winner" from the tariffs, causing their stock to rise.</li>
    <li>The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks initially extended a rally sparked by hopes for de-escalation of US-China trade talks, but year-to-date, the stocks are still down overall. One firm cut its Apple price target citing consumer demand and supply chain problems all related to tariffs.</li>
    <li><b>Intel</b> stock experienced gains ahead of its first earnings report under the leadership of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. However, the company faces potential challenges related to the trade war and possible job cuts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Federal Reserve and Monetary Policy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack influenced market sentiment. While ruling out an interest rate cut in May, she suggested that a June cut could be possible if economic data is clear and convincing. However, it is worth noting Fed Chair Jerome Powell previously warned about the potential for persistent inflation and slower growth due to President Trump's tariff policies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cryptocurrency and Market Trends</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bitcoin experienced a surge, reaching $93,000 per coin. The launch of Twenty One Capital, a new bitcoin-focused company, fueled investor sentiment.</li>
    <li>As Bitcoin rises, the meme coin associated with Trump, DJT, saw a large surge in value as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Economic Indicators and Analysis</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Goldman Sachs revised its first-quarter GDP forecast downwards, indicating a likely contraction of the U.S. economy.</li>
    <li>Data on durable goods suggested slower inventory growth than previously anticipated.  An emerging theme in the US economy is the idea of businesses and consumers front-running tariffs by pulling forward spending to get ahead of price increases.</li>
    <li>The resale housing market is showing signs of strain, with high mortgage rates sidelining buyers and deepening affordability challenges.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall Outlook</h2>
<p>The stock market remains highly sensitive to developments in the U.S.-China trade war and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. The economic outlook is clouded by uncertainty, with some companies already experiencing tangible impacts from tariffs and trade-related anxieties. Investors should remain cautious and monitor economic indicators closely, as the market navigates a complex and evolving landscape.</p>
