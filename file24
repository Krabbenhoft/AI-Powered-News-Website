   Don't worry, you've come to a safe space.

   To be clear, the same can't be said for the rest of the internet, which
   every April Fools' Day lards its usual mystery blend of fact, rumor and
   misinformation with, well, still more misinformation — this time in the
   service of what some allege to be humor.

   But you've found sanctuary in the next few hundred words, promise. Here
   are six real books coming out this week, with dust jackets that reflect
   their real contents: mysteries and mishaps, often told with a sly
   smirk. Because something has to make sense in this crazy world, dang
   it.

   Children of Radium: A Buried Inheritance
   Scribner

   Children of Radium: A Buried Inheritance, by Joe Dunthorne

   The Welsh-born novelist seeks to unearth, and untangle, one
   particularly gnarled root of his family tree: his great-grandfather, a
   Jewish chemist who fled the Nazis in the mid-1930s. While true, this
   story of daring escape, passed down like a family heirloom, always
   obscured another, rather complicating detail: that same
   great-grandfather simultaneously was developing chemical weapons for
   the Nazi regime. Dunthorne's attempt to understand this painful paradox
   interweaves memoir, archival research, travelogue and a fair bit of
   family therapy.

   Flesh: A Novel
   Scribner

   Flesh, by David Szalay

   Spare and detached on the page, lush in resonance beyond it, Szalay's
   new novel reads a bit like an immigrant bildungsroman flavored with
   Albert Camus. At the heart of it all is István, a Hungarian teen making
   his first stumbling steps into adulthood beset by trauma, flashes of
   violence and the more mundane misunderstandings that come to shape his
   life. It is the Hungary-based, British-raised novelist's first book in
   seven years, and his second since being shortlisted for the [68]Booker
   Prize in 2016.

   I See You've Called in Dead: A Novel
   Zibby Publishing

   I See You've Called in Dead, by John Kenney

   It doesn't sound outlandish that a professional obituary writer would
   draft an obituary for himself at one time or another – perhaps even
   featuring a few flattering embellishments, why not? But problems arise
   when said writer – Bud Stanley, the ill-starred hero of Kenney's comic
   novel – drunkenly publishes this whopper-laden exercise in wish
   fulfillment during his own lifetime. Opportunities arise too, though,
   and it's not long before his own death turns his life on its head.

   Rabbit Moon
   Little, Brown and Company

   Rabbit Moon, by Jennifer Haigh

   Separated for years by the centrifugal forces of divorce and
   estrangement, the Litvak family is yanked back together by tragedy:
   Daughter Lindsey, victim of a hit-and-run car collision, lies in a coma
   in a hospital in Shanghai, while the parents she left half a world away
   must reunite at her bedside, to piece together clues of the life she
   lived without them. It's a portrait, told in time jumps, of a family
   fractured by nothing so much as their own profoundly human flaws.

   The Usual Desire to Kill: A Novel
   Scribner

   The Usual Desire to Kill, by Camilla Barnes

   A good rule of thumb: Any novel that so explicitly references homicide
   in its title is probably a murder mystery, or something to do with
   marriage. In this case, it's the latter, and those violent urges belong
   primarily to the intransigent couple's adult daughter, who has been
   unwillingly conscripted into the role of peacemaker. So don't expect
   premeditated murder, exactly – but there may well be some dialogue
   sharp enough to draw blood in this tragicomic debut novel.

   Vera Wong's Guide to Snooping (on a Dead Man)
   Berkley

   Vera Wong's Guide to Snooping (On a Dead Man), by Jesse Q. Sutanto

   She's not Hercule Poirot, exactly, but Vera Wong is no rookie gumshoe
   either. In Vera Wong's Unsolicited Advice for Murderers, published in
   2023, the 60-something teashop owner and meddling mother already
   demonstrated her sleuthing skills – and her utter inability to just
   mind her own business. Sutanto's big-hearted follow up finds the
   meddlesome detective taking on a new case – the disappearance of a
   mysterious social media influencer – whether or not anyone actually
   asked for her help. Vera knows they need her, don't worry.
