[134]Did the unitary executive theory pave the way for President Trump's
second term?

   March 24, 2025 • In the past month, two federal judges have ordered
   federal agencies to reinstate thousands of federal employees, including
   those at USDA, decisions the Trump administration strongly disagrees
   with and is appealing, and that has led to a stressful state of limbo.
   For the time being, they have jobs, but only until the appeals process
   plays out. It's not clear to the employee we talk to or others whether
   this is permanent or just another few weeks. The legal back-and-forth
   center on questions about the limits of President Trump's power. It is
   a power that was expanded by the Supreme Court last summer, through its
   ruling in Trump v. the United States, the immunity case.

Did the unitary executive theory pave the way for President Trump's second
term?
