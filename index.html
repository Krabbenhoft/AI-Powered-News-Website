 <h2>International Relations and Trade</h2>
 <p>
  The Trump administration's trade policies continue to significantly impact global commerce.
  Recently imposed tariffs, specifically a 25% surcharge on foreign cars, have already led to layoffs and pauses in car shipments.
  Jaguar Land Rover Automotive, a major British car manufacturer, has announced it is pausing shipments to the U.S. in April, developing long term plans to adapt to the changing landscape of trade. This is not an isolated issue, with other British carmakers expected to take similar action, potentially exacerbating struggles the industry faces due to demand decline and shift to electric vehicles.
  These tariffs, imposed by the Trump administration, are defended as a means to grow U.S. manufacturing.
  A key component of this strategy are "reciprocal" tariffs, which are intended to offset trade deficits.
  According to the Trump administration's economic calculations, tariffs are meant to raise prices on foreign goods, which, in turn, is expected to encourage U.S. consumers to purchase American-made products, thus closing the trade deficit.
  Critics, however, argue that the administration's calculations are oversimplified.
  The move to impose tariffs also goes hand in hand with efforts to close other trade loopholes
  The administration is also trying to cut down on low value goods imported directly to customers, a move that will affect shoppers who purchase inexpensive goods online from oversees retailers.
  The move may disproportionately impact lower-income consumers who rely on these lower-cost goods to save money.
