   SPARTA, MICHIGAN - MARCH 20: U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and
   Director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural
   Development Tim Boring host a listening session with Michigan farmers
   and agriculture industry leaders on tariffs, immigration, H5N1, and
   rural economic development on March 20, 2025 in Sparta, Michigan. The
   session comes two days after Michigan farmers held a "tractor rally" at
   the capitol and testified before the Michigan House Oversight Committee
   on burdensome regulations such as water withdrawal restrictions,
   hazardous waste permit requirements, wetland regulations, fees, fines
   and permit approval time that have increased costs on the agriculture
   industry.(Photo by Chris duMond/Getty Images)

   The auto industry is already feeling the effects of President Trump's
   broad and sweeping tariffs.

   Days after the [70]president's tariff announcement, Stellantis, which
   makes Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge, announced that [71]900 people would be
   temporarily laid off. The affected U.S. employees work in factories
   across the Midwest, including Michigan, a state where the auto industry
   drives the economy and where voters helped elect Trump for a second
   presidential term.

   Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan told Morning Edition that
   she cannot "overstate the level of instability and open questions about
   the future." She expressed concern for the auto workers and [72]farmers
   in her state, many of whom were affected by Trump's tariffs during his
   first term.

   "Trump did this in his first administration," Slotkin said. "I live on
   my family farm. We lease our farm to a soybean farmer. Soybeans were
   targeted in the tariff war in the first Trump administration. We've
   never made up market share from the markets we lost. China just stopped
   buying from us, and they went to Brazil and to Argentina. We just
   permanently lost that market."

   "So we're waiting for the next shoe to drop, but it's a lot of
   instability," she added.

   Trump maintains that tariffs will benefit U.S. manufacturers and
   strengthen the nation's position in the global trading system.

   NPR's Michel Martin spoke to Slotkin about how the new tariffs are
   already affecting the people of Michigan.

   The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity.

Interview Highlights

   Michel Martin: What are you hearing from your home state, especially
   from autoworkers, since we're hearing that people are already being
   laid off?

   Slotkin: I can't overstate the level of instability and open questions
   about the future. It to me, it's the same level of uncertainty from our
   business leaders, our auto workers, our farmers that we had during
   COVID five years ago, where you kind of don't know what's going to
   happen next.

   Obviously, on the manufacturing side we are trying to understand what
   this is going to do. But I think it's hard to say that it won't do
   anything other than raise prices of cars.

   But for me, we haven't yet seen the next chess moves from the other
   countries. China just this morning announced what their retaliation is.
   All these other countries are about to announce a retaliation and they
   get to pick and choose where it hurts us most. And so I'm very
   concerned about our farmers, which is a big part of our industry in
   Michigan.
   [73]The Senate has approved a measure pushing back on the 25 percent
   tariff on Canada imposed by President Trump. The measure, sponsored by
   Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was approved with GOP support but is not
   expected to ever come up for a vote in the House.

[74]Politics

[75]Senate rebukes Trump's tariffs on Canada

   Martin: You supported a resolution in the Senate to revoke the tariffs
   on Canadian goods. It did get some bipartisan support, but it's
   non-binding and it's unlikely to see a vote in the House. Congress is
   supposed to play a role in trade policy. The work around for this
   administration has been by declaring it an emergency.

   What's the next step here?

   Slotkin: I think everyone understands we need a 21st century trade
   policy. And there are plenty of countries that are cheating in the
   international system, particularly China. We understand that. I think
   it's just doing it strategically and responsibly and not this kind of
   slapstick way that they're doing it that risks raising prices and
   hurting the economy.

   You're right. We passed this resolution. It was a non-binding
   resolution. But can we just take note, it was the first time that
   anything has passed in the House that pushes back on Trump's policies
   since he was sworn in.

   Martin: I have to note that the tariffs are being pitched as a way to
   bring jobs back to the United States. We know that President Trump made
   inroads with union voters in his last campaign, including in your
   state.

   Is your main goal or task right now to persuade your colleagues that
   this is bad economic policy or to persuade voters that they need to be
   more vocal that this is hurting them?

   Slotkin: The voters, they understand their own pocketbooks. They may
   not understand the federal budget and all the ins and outs of all these
   things. They understand the price of a car. They understand the price
   of milk, coffee and sugar. They understand the basic things in their
   lives. So, we're going to see. We're going to see in the next couple of
   weeks what this does. No one wants anything other than to bring jobs
   back home, but people need some predictability. Things don't flip
   overnight.

   China just today put a huge retaliatory tariff on rare earth minerals,
   we just don't dig a lot of rare earth minerals out of the ground in the
   United States of America. That doesn't happen overnight. So, I think
   people are going to start to feel that pain. And again, no one wants
   that. We don't want a recession. We don't want that pain. We want jobs
   back. And a strategic policy does that not this kind of slap stick
   approach.
