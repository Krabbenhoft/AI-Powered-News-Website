   A MARTÍNEZ, BYLINE: College basketball fans are looking forward to the
   men's final four this weekend. While the top seeds in this year's
   tournament get ready for their semifinal games, most other basketball
   programs are starting to think about next season. For the Indiana
   Hoosiers, it means literally starting from scratch after their head
   coach resigned and all of their players graduated or are planning to
   transfer. Joining us now to discuss how Indiana is rebuilding their
   team with a new coach and no players is Zach Osterman, who reports on
   IU Athletics for The Indianapolis Star. Well, this is the definition,
   Zach, of a clean slate. So how is the new head coach, Darian DeVries,
   approaching this challenge?

   ZACH OSTERMAN: Yeah, I think this roster turnover has become more
   manageable in recent years with the escalating phenomenon of player
   movement and the lessening of transfer rules. And so you were seeing
   more often, you know, rosters turning over insignificant numbers,
   sometimes even when there isn't a coaching change. I think DeVries,
   like any coach, certainly wants to get to a place where, annually,
   there is more balance, where you're not dependent upon transfers. I
   think that's certainly what DeVries is going to be focused on is
   putting his roster back together primarily through transfers.

   MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. So he can reload pretty quickly. Even though he's
   losing players, he can reload them through this transfer portal. So
   tell us about the transfer portal, what it does and why it makes it
   easier for players to move around.

   OSTERMAN: So the transfer portal started a few years ago. It's a
   mechanism to be able to just track transfers a little bit more closely,
   streamline the process somewhat as the practice of transferring, you
   know, started to really sort of tick up across all sports. I think
   what's happened is, especially when it's been sort of coupled to the
   idea of athlete compensation through name image and likeness rules. The
   portal has really, I think, come to be sort of inextricably linked to
   the idea of athlete agency. It has also become, I think, shorthand,
   just for the era that college athletics is in right now of athletes in
   all sports being more comfortable transferring from one school to
   another and, in many cases, I think, looking or at least wanting to
   examine their market value to see if there's not more money for them to
   earn somewhere else.

   MARTÍNEZ: I was thinking in the Indiana situation, the one thing
   DeVries can offer a player that maybe other coaches can't is playing
   time. I mean, he has no players - right? - so someone has to actually
   dribble the basketball - at least five people have to do it, and maybe
   someone or a couple of others on the bench. So what kind of a player do
   you think he'll be looking for?

   OSTERMAN: I mean, initially, he's probably going to have to lean more
   heavily on transfers, especially in, as you talk about there, the
   positions that are going to command the greatest roles. DeVries has
   said that his long-term preference is to get to a place where, you
   know, his roster is a healthier balance of players who have been
   recruited out of high school, developed for two or three years and then
   put into larger roles. But short-term, I think you are probably, if
   you're Indiana looking at a roster that's going to be mostly all new
   faces.

   MARTÍNEZ: It sounds like Indiana's situation, although seemingly on the
   surface unique, is not maybe going to be as uncommon in the future.

   OSTERMAN: This has just become more commonplace, and fans see enough
   portal successes every year to believe that they shouldn't have that
   many down years anymore, especially at a place like Indiana that's
   going to have the name, image and likeness resources and potentially
   the revenue-sharing dollars to be very competitive in acquiring and
   keeping talent.

   MARTÍNEZ: That's Zach Osterman with The Indianapolis Star. Zach, thanks
   a lot.

   OSTERMAN: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.
