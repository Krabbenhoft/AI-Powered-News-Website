Who We Are

   NPR is an independent, nonprofit media organization that was founded on
   a mission to create a more informed public. Every day, NPR connects
   with millions of Americans on the air, online, and in person to explore
   the news, ideas, and what it means to be human. Through its network of
   member stations, NPR makes local stories national, national stories
   local, and global stories personal.

   The mission of NPR is to collaborate with Member Stations to cultivate
   an informed public, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation
   of events, ideas, and cultures. To achieve this, we produce, acquire,
   and distribute programming that upholds the highest standards of public
   service in journalism and cultural expression. We also advocate for our
   members' shared interests and provide satellite interconnection for the
   entire public radio system.

NPR Network

   NPR Network image

   The links between NPR and Member Stations are many and deep. At the
   core, we share a mission to inform the public, increase understanding
   of the world and enrich the experience of everyday life. Every day, NPR
   and its Member stations work together to tell the story of the whole
   country from everywhere in the country.

   No other news organization has the same on-the-ground reach as public
   media. Approximately 99% of the U.S. population is within the broadcast
   listening area of one or more public radio stations. This network
   includes thousands of journalists at nearly 250 NPR Member stations
   across the country, in addition to the hundreds of journalists working
   at NPR.

  Supported by Listeners

   Our work is made possible through the support we receive from people
   across the country who count on and care about the news and programming
   we provide. Gifts of any size from our growing audience on-air and
   online help NPR and Member stations fulfill our shared mission.

  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion As Core Values

   At NPR, diversity is the unending pursuit of meaningful inclusion in
   the face of historic and present-day exclusion. It is a value that must
   live in all that we are and all that we do, beginning with the Board of
   Directors and cascading down to every corner of the enterprise. It must
   live in our content, hiring, audience and workplace; in our business
   deals, our partnerships, and our collaborations with stations across
   the network.

   Diversity is a big tent. It covers race and ethnicity, gender, sexual
   orientation, gender identity, social class, faith, age, disabilities
   and abilities, political persuasion and geographic location. It
   embraces veteran status and family structures, marital status and
   national origin, immigration status and educational attainment.
   Inclusion brings that diversity and more to bear on the work we do and
   makes it possible for everyone at NPR to grow and thrive.

  Work with Purpose

   Talented professionals with an incredibly diverse array of talents and
   backgrounds — from audio, print, and visual journalists, to developers,
   designers, engineers, executives, communications specialists, IT
   experts, lawyers, accountants and so much more — all coming together to
   create, support and promote NPR's award-winning content.
