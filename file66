   Public Radio Finances An overview of the funding story at NPR and at
   our Member stations. While NPR shares a mission with our stations, we
   are funded in significantly different ways.

Public Radio Finances

   June 20, 20134:23 PM ET

   While NPR shares a mission with our Member organizations, we are funded
   in significantly different but interrelated ways.
     __________________________________________________________________

NPR Revenues

   NPR is an independent, non-profit media organization. We are also a
   membership organization of separately licensed and operated public
   radio stations across the United States. Station membership in NPR is a
   local public radio station editorial and business decision.

   NPR's two largest revenue sources are corporate sponsorships and fees
   paid by NPR Member organizations to support a suite of programs, tools,
   and services. Other sources of revenue include institutional grants,
   individual contributions and fees paid by users of the Public Radio
   Satellite System (public radio station interconnection and
   distribution).

   Breakdown of NPR's Revenue
   NPR's average consolidated revenues from changes in net assets without
   donor restrictions (FY20-FY24). Corporate sponsorships 36%; Core and
   other programming fees 30%; Contributions of cash and financial assets
   13%; Other revenues 7%; Satellite interconnection and distribution 5%;
   NPR Foundation Board-designated and endowment support 5%; Return on
   short-term investments, net 1%

   Fees from NPR Member organizations

   Organizations that choose to be NPR Members pay two types of fees to
   NPR, 100% of which support the Member benefits that NPR provides:
     * A core fee that includes the NPR newsmagazines (Morning Edition,
       All Things Considered, Weekend Edition) for news format stations,
       an array of digital content, tools and platforms, and a suite of
       services designed to drive audience engagement and support.
     * License fees for an optional portfolio of individual broadcast
       programs offering current affairs, entertainment, and cultural
       topics.

   The core fee calculation is based on a percentage of stations' local
   membership revenue, as a reflection of the value that NPR programs and
   services provide to Members and their communities.

   The license fees for individual news/talk, entertainment, and music
   programs (e.g. programs like Fresh Air, Here & Now, 1A, World Cafe, or
   Throughline) are based on pricing tiers based on each Member's total
   revenue.

   The fee model includes provisions that recognize Members with
   particular characteristics that contribute to NPR's audience service
   mission, including Members designated by CPB as serving rural and
   minority audiences.

   Corporate Sponsorship Support

   Covering the news worldwide for our Member organizations and their
   audiences requires significant resources. The funds NPR receives from
   corporate donors are an important part of the revenues that support
   NPR's in-depth reporting and programming, but only a part.

   Corporate sponsors do not influence NPR's coverage, and our
   journalistic firewall prevents them from doing so. NPR journalists have
   no role in selecting corporate sponsors, and adhere to a journalistic
   code of ethics which prevents outside groups from influencing their
   objectivity, story selection, and reporting. When news warrants, we
   will report on the activities of companies that support NPR as we would
   any other company — with independent, objective, and fair reporting.

   Messages acknowledging NPR's national sponsors are presented on-air in
   short announcements, and are presented in visual and audio form on
   NPR.org and other digital services. NPR has a rigorous process for
   reviewing those national sponsorship messages in accordance with FCC
   guidelines.

   NPR makes decisions about national corporate sponsors based on
   principles established by NPR's Board of Directors. Under those
   principles, NPR has no list of sources from which funding will be
   refused. However, potential conflicts of interest or similar concerns
   are considered in accepting or rejecting support from particular
   entities.

   This approach results in a diverse pool of funders which is an
   important basis of NPR's impartiality as a news organization. To impose
   a litmus test to accept or reject funding from an organization would
   create the appearance that NPR as a news organization has taken a
   position on the issues related to that organization.

   NPR is represented by [60]National Public Media LLC (NPM), a
   majority-owned subsidiary of NPR Asset Holding Company, Inc., a
   wholly-owned subsidiary of NPR. As noted above, NPR journalists have no
   role in selecting corporate sponsors.

   Grants and Contributions

   Grants from institutions and non-profits have made it possible for NPR
   to maintain its current programming, and launch new programs and
   initiatives. They have also allowed NPR to expand coverage of major
   news topics including international news, education, science, the
   environment, and the economy. Many of these grants also directly and
   indirectly benefit Member organizations, for example in the
   establishment of collaborative newsrooms among Members that support
   deeper reporting on local and regional issues with access to editorial
   resources from NPR. NPR and Member organizations share a common mission
   and many of the same strategic goals. Together, the NPR network is
   increasingly engaging philanthropic partners at high levels. These
   individuals and families are interested in supporting transformational,
   strategic advancements in public media's capacity to meet information
   needs across the country. The NPR Foundation, working in collaboration
   with Member organizations, is poised to make a significant contribution
   to the individual giving fundraising capacity of public media — to the
   benefit of all.

   Distribution from NPR Foundation Board-Designated and Endowment Funds
   to Support Operations

   The NPR Foundation provides funding for NPR's operations, drawing on
   earnings from funds that include the 2003 bequest from [61]Joan B. Kroc
   and other endowment funds, as well as a Board-designated fund. In
   addition, NPR earns revenue on its short and long-term investments.

   Interconnection and Distribution

   NPR's Distribution division manages and operates the Public Radio
   Satellite System ("PRSS"), which is a terrestrial, satellite and
   digital distribution system that interconnects public radio producers,
   distributors and stations. The PRSS is the nationwide infrastructure
   backbone of the public radio system and its ability to deliver
   national, state, and local emergency alerts as well as other local and
   national news and programming. The PRSS distributes content to more
   than 1,200 public radio stations on behalf of public radio stations and
   CPB. As a portion of its revenue, the PRSS collects fees from stations
   and producers for the use of the interconnection system for broadcast
   distribution. In addition, the PRSS offers excess satellite capacity to
   both public radio and non-public radio users for private networks to
   keep the cost of distribution as low as possible for stations.

   Other Revenues

   Additional revenues include facility rental income, royalties,
   licensing of programming, and other fees.
     __________________________________________________________________

NPR Expenses

   The vast majority of NPR's expenses are devoted to producing and
   presenting news, technical support for radio programs and journalists,
   the distribution of programs to stations and digital media services
   like NPR.org.

   The balance is spent on service for Member organizations, facilities
   and information services, corporate sponsorship and fundraising, legal
   services, human resources, marketing and communications, and overall
   management of NPR.

   Breakdown of NPR's Expenses
   NPR's average consolidated operating expenses (FY20-FY24). Content
   production and distribution 58%; Support services 30%; Content support
   and other program activities 12%

   ^1Non-operating expenses (e.g. depreciation, amortization, interest,
   losses of disposition on fixed assets) are not included.

   ^2"Content production and distribution" includes expenses incurred by
   NPR's News and information, Programming, Engineering, NPR Music, and
   Distribution divisions. "Content support and other program activities"
   includes expenses incurred by NPR's Product and Audience Technology,
   Member Partnership, and Network Growth divisions. "Support services"
   includes expenses managerial and general expenses such as those
   incurred by the following divisions: Development; Sponsorship;
   Facilities; Information Technology; Audience Growth; Communications;
   Finance; People Team; Office of the General Counsel; and Executive
   leadership offices.

   501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Exempt
   Organizations"). Exempt Organizations file the Form 990-T to report
   unrelated business income, figure and report unrelated business income
   tax liability, and report proxy tax liability, if any. The amounts in
   the Forms 990 and 990-T are presented in accordance with IRS
   regulations which vary from generally accepted accounting principles.

   NPR Inc. and the NPR Foundation file Forms 990 and 990-T. The American
   Coalition for Public Radio and NPR International Operations, Inc. file
   Form 990 because neither has unrelated business income.

Member Station Revenues

   As you can see in the following chart, public radio stations rely most
   heavily on contributions from listeners. Sponsorship from local
   companies and organizations (also known as corporate sponsorship or
   business support) is the second largest source of support to stations.

   Breakdown of Member Organization's Revenues
   Public Radio Station Revenue Sources (FY22). Individuals 49%;
   Investments and other 1%; Corporations 17%; Colleges and universities
   9%; Foundations 10%; Federal appropriation via CPB 8%; Federal, state
   and local governments 6%
   NPR

   Public Radio and Federal Funding

   Federal funding is essential to public radio's service to the American
   public and its continuation is critical for both stations and program
   producers, including NPR. It underpins the public-private partnership
   that has always existed within public media, and it is vital for
   supporting access to news and information, educational resources,
   noncommercial music, and emergency alerting services for the entire
   nation.

   Eligible public radio stations may apply to receive annual grants
   directly from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) that make
   up an important part of a diverse revenue mix that includes listener
   support, corporate sponsorship and grants. These stations, in turn,
   draw on a mix of public and privately-sourced revenue to run their
   organizations, including opting to license programs and services from
   NPR and other public radio producers.

   70% of the federal appropriation to CPB is distributed directly to
   eligible local public radio and television stations in the form of an
   annual community service grant. Stations have autonomy in determining
   how to spend their federal grants to best serve their local audience
   service and community. CPB funding comprises on average approximately
   8% of a public radio station's budget, and that percentage is highest
   among rural stations or stations in areas that are otherwise
   underserved, due to the challenges they face in raising additional
   revenue.

   Federal funding is an essential investment into local nonprofit,
   noncommercial public radio and television organizations, who rely on
   this funding to plan for the additional resources needed to support
   their operations, and take the actions needed to raise those funds and
   achieve a balanced budget. For every federal grant dollar received, on
   average, a public radio station is able to leverage those funds to
   raise seven times the amount from other sources such as local listener,
   foundation and business support.

   Eliminating funding or restricting stations from using their federal
   grants as they determine in their local interest would force those
   stations to procure or recreate these resources on their own (less
   efficiently and at a greater cost) or to eliminate public service
   programming that audiences want and need. The loss of federal funding
   could undermine stations' ability to procure programming, thereby
   weakening the local audience service and public media system
   institution.

   Elimination of federal funding would ultimately result in fewer
   programs, less journalism — especially local journalism — and
   eventually the loss of public radio stations, particularly in rural and
   economically distressed communities.

   Public media stations receive support from many sources, including:
     * listener contributions
     * corporate sponsorship
     * in-kind and direct support from universities (when licensed to a
       college or university)
     * foundation grants and major gifts
     * grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
     * in some cases, state and local governments

   On average, approximately 1% of NPR's annual operating budget comes in
   the form of grants from CPB and federal agencies and departments,
   excluding CPB funding for the Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS).
