<h1>August 25, 2025: Market Reacts to Powell, Musk Sues, and Trump's Investment Strategy</h1>

<p>The stock market experienced mixed performance today, August 25, 2025, with the S&P 500 slipping after a strong rally on Friday. Friday's rally was spurred by remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, hinting at potential rate cuts in September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also pulled back, while technology stocks, particularly Intel and Nvidia, provided support to the Nasdaq Composite. Investors are keenly awaiting Nvidia's earnings report scheduled for Wednesday.</p>

<h2>Market Overview</h2>
<p>Stocks opened lower on Monday, reversing course from the previous trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average initially showed losses of over 200 points. This comes as investors digest Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium, where he suggested the door is open for a rate cut in September. However, some analysts believe the enthusiasm may be restrained until there is more certainty regarding the Fed's actions, citing a lot to endure before being convinced that the Fed will be cutting rates. CFRA Research's Sam Stovall suggested Friday's gains may have been partially due to short covering. Some traders are taking profits after a period of gains.</p>

<h2>Key Stock Movements</h2>
<p><b>Nvidia</b> shares rose approximately 2%, buoyed by optimism ahead of their earnings report on Wednesday. This positive sentiment was amplified after Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick revealed on Friday that the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake in the chipmaker.
President Trump stated, "I PAID ZERO FOR INTEL, IT IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY 11 BILLION DOLLARS. All goes to the USA. Why are 'stupid' people unhappy with that? I will make deals like that for our Country all day long,"
</p>

<p><b>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP)</b> experienced a significant drop, shedding 7% in midday trading, following the announcement of a deal to acquire Dutch coffee company JDE Peet's for around $18 billion. Once the deal is completed, Keurig plans to split up its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies.  This move would effectively unwind the 2018 merger between Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple.</p>

<p><b>American Eagle</b> was downgraded by Bank of America. Analyst Christopher Nardone downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral and lowered his price objective to $10 per share from $11, suggesting more than 21% downside from Friday's close.</p>

<p><b>Alaska Air Group</b> received an upgrade from Raymond James to outperform, with a target price of $70 per share, indicating potential upside of 18% from Friday's closing price.</p>

<p><b>Orsted</b> shares plunged to a record low following the U.S. government's order to halt construction of a wind project off the coast of Rhode Island.  The project is 80% complete.</p>

<p><b>Intel</b> shares rose following confirmation of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company, which Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced on X.  President Trump said that the U.S. government will make more deals that are reminiscent of its recent stake in Intel, Trump says U.S. government will make deals similar to Intel stake ‘all day long’.</p>

<h2>Geopolitical and Economic Factors</h2>

<h2>Sector-Specific News</h2>
