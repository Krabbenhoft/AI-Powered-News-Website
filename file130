   Underscoring the massive scale of America's medical debt problem, a
   nonprofit has struck a deal to pay off old medical bills for an
   estimated 20 million people.

   New York-based [76]Undue Medical Debt, which buys patient debt, is
   paying off $30 billion worth of unpaid bills in a single transaction
   with Pendrick Capital Partners, a Virginia-based debt trading company.
   The average patient debt being retired is $1,100, according to Undue
   Medical Debt, with some reaching the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

   The deal will prevent the debt being sold and protect [77]millions of
   people nationwide from being targeted by collectors, though this will
   overwhelmingly benefit residents of Texas and Florida, who account for
   about half of the debts being retired.

   the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 6, 2025.

[79]Policy-ish

[80]Trump vowed to end surprise medical bills. The team working on that just
got slashed

   Despite the size of this deal, however, even proponents of retiring
   patient debt acknowledge that such purchases cannot solve a crisis that
   now touches around[81] 100 million people in the U.S.

   "We don't think that the way we finance health care is sustainable,"
   Undue Medical Debt chief executive Allison Sesso said. "Medical debt
   has unreasonable expectations…the people who owe the debts can't pay."

   In the past year alone, Americans borrowed an estimated $74 billion to
   pay for health care, a [82]West Health-Gallup survey found. And even
   those who benefit from Undue's debt relief may have other medical debt
   that won't be relieved.

   This large purchase also highlights the challenges that debt
   collectors, hospitals, and other health care providers face as patients
   rack up big bills that aren't covered by their health insurance.

   Pendrick's chief executive, Chris Eastman, declined several requests to
   be interviewed about the debt sale, which has not been previously
   reported. But Eastman acknowledged in[83] a 2024 podcast episode that
   collecting medical debts has grown more challenging as regulators have
   restricted how collectors can pursue patients.

   Pendrick has now shuttered, which Sesso said provided strong motivation
   for this deal.

   "This was a really great opportunity to get a debt buyer out of the
   market," she said.

   Undue Medical Debt[84] pioneered its debt relief strategy a decade ago,
   using charitable donations to buy medical debt from debt trading
   companies at steeply discounted prices and then freeing patients from
   the obligation to pay.

   The nonprofit now buys debts directly from hospitals, as well. And it
   is working with about two dozen state and local governments to leverage
   public money to relieve medical debt in communities from Los Angeles
   County to Cleveland to the state of Connecticut.

   The approach has been controversial, and Undue Medical Debt's
   record-setting purchase — financed by a mix of philanthropy and
   taxpayer dollars — is likely to stoke more debate over the value of
   paying collectors for medical debts.

   "The approach is just treating the symptoms and not the disease," said
   Elisabeth Benjamin, a vice president at the Community Service Society
   of New York, a nonprofit that has led efforts to restrict aggressive
   hospital collections. Benjamin and other advocates say systemic changes
   such as ensuring hospitals offer sufficient financial aid to patients
   and reining in high medical prices would be more valuable in preventing
   people from sinking into debt.

   But many government officials see retiring people's unpaid medical
   bills as useful if it's part of a larger strategy for localities,
   states or even hospitals and health systems to help patients avoid debt
   in the first place.

   "Turning off the tap is what's really important in the long run," said
   Naman Shah, a physician who directs medical affairs at the Los Angeles
   County Department of Public Health. To do that, the county is[85]
   working to improve local hospital financial aid programs for patients,
   so people don't end up in debt in the first place. But Shah said debt
   relief is key, as well.

    "It's easy to criticize band-aids when you're not the one who's cut,"
   he said. "As a physician, I take care of people who have cuts, and I
   know the importance of stitching them back up."

   Undue Medical Debt's latest deal, which it is spending $36 million to
   close, will help patients nationwide, according to the nonprofit. But
   about half the estimated 20 million people whose debts Pendrick owned
   live in just two states: Texas or Florida.

   Neither has expanded Medicaid coverage through the 2010 Affordable Care
   Act, a key tool that[86] researchers have found bolsters patients'
   financial security by protecting them from big medical bills and debt.

   The patients eligible for debt relief have incomes at or below four
   times the federal poverty level, about $63,000 for a single person, or
   debts that exceed 5% of their incomes.

   About half the debts are also more than seven years old. These have
   been donated to Undue Medical Debt by Pendrick, the group reported.

   The nonprofit plans to pay for the rest of the debts over the next year
   and a half, though all collections have stopped against patients. It
   also plans to spend an additional $40 million — or $2 a person — to
   process the debts, find patients, and inform them that their debts have
   been relieved.

   Sesso, Undue's chief executive, said she hopes the debt purchase will
   keep policymakers focused on enacting longer-term solutions to the
   nation's medical debt crisis.

   She applauded state leaders for[87] taking steps to bar medical debts
   from their residents' credit scores. But she said action is also needed
   in Washington, D.C. However, the Trump administration has suspended
   regulations[88] enacted under former President Joe Biden that would
   have barred credit reporting of medical debt nationally, and
   congressional Republicans are now moving to revoke the new rules.

   "There is a limit to what state and local governments can do to solve
   this problem," Sesso said. "It's really a national problem that has to
   be solved at the national level."
