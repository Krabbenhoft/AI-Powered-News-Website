<h1>Recent News Summary: Trade War Intensifies, Markets Tumble</h1>

<p>On Thursday, April 10, 2025, the US stock market experienced a significant downturn as President Donald Trump's administration clarified its stance on tariffs, particularly concerning China. This clarification exacerbated existing anxieties about a potential trade war, triggering volatility across various financial sectors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had seen a remarkable surge the previous day, experienced a sharp reversal, plummeting over 2,100 points midday before recovering partially. Similarly, the Nasdaq, after its second-best daily gain in history, also faced a substantial correction.</p>

<h2>Background: "Liberation Day" and Initial Relief</h2>

<p>The market's woes stem from President Trump's earlier tariff announcements, dubbed "Liberation Day" tariffs, which initially sent shockwaves through the global economy. These tariffs, which involved hefty levies on dozens of countries, raised concerns about hampered consumer spending and rising inflation. However, there was a brief period of optimism on Wednesday when President Trump paused most of his "reciprocal" tariffs for 90 days, leading to a strong market rally.</p>

<h2>The Clarification: China Targeted with Increased Tariffs</h2>

<p>The momentary relief was short-lived. The White House clarified that goods imported from China would now be subject to a staggering 145% tariff. This was not the previously announced 125%, the additional 20% are those tariffs already in place on China. This move effectively intensified the trade war between the US and China, causing stocks to immediately decline.</p>

<h2>China's Response: Retaliation and Negotiation</h2>

<p>In response to the US tariffs, Beijing implemented retaliatory tariffs of 84% on US imports. Despite these measures, China expressed its willingness to negotiate with the United States, but reiterated that it would not back down if Trump further escalated the trade war. A spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry emphasized the need for mutual respect and equality in any dialogue, stating that pressure and threats would not be effective.</p>

<h2>Economic Concerns and Expert Opinions</h2>

<p>Economists remain concerned about the long-term impact of the trade war, even with the temporary pause on some tariffs. Many believe that the economic damage is already done, and the risk of a US and global recession remains elevated. Goldman Sachs estimated recession chances in the United States were still a coin flip, while JPMorgan maintained its 60% chance of a US and global recession forecast.</p>

<p>Experts suggest that the recent events are merely postponing what is likely to be a series of punitive import taxes on US trade allies. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, surged significantly, reflecting the heightened uncertainty in the market.</p>

<h2>Broader Market Trends</h2>

<p>Beyond stocks, other markets also showed signs of stress. The bond market, which had been selling off rapidly, cooled off slightly. Oil prices fell sharply, reflecting concerns about reduced demand due to the trade war. Gold prices, considered a safe haven asset, hit a fresh record high.</p>

<h2>Global Market Reactions</h2>

<p>Despite the turbulence in the US market, global markets generally recovered on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index finished significantly higher, and European stocks surged after the European Commission President paused retaliatory tariffs and welcomed Trump's move to pause his "reciprocal" tariffs.</p>

<h2>Retail Investor Behavior</h2>

<p>Notably, retail investors have been "buying the dip," that is purchasing stocks when they decline because they're considered discounted, continuing to pump money into the market. While Wall Street worried, retail traders bought approximately $11 billion in stocks, according to JPMorgan.</p>

<h2>Other Impacts</h2>

<p>Wells Fargo warned that construction costs are poised to rise because of trade measures. Specifically, materials like steel, aluminum, copper, and lumber are seeing price increases that will make things difficult for both residential and commercia
