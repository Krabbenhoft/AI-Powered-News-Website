<h1>Market Volatility Amidst Trade Tensions and Inflation Concerns: May 15, 2025</h1>

<p>The U.S. stock market experienced mixed performance on Thursday, May 15, 2025, amidst a complex interplay of factors including trade tensions, inflation concerns, and corporate earnings reports. While the S&P 500 closed higher for a fourth consecutive day, fueled by a soft inflation report and falling Treasury yields, the Nasdaq faced headwinds, particularly from declines in major technology stocks.</p>

<h2>Trade Developments and Tariff Impacts</h2>

<p>Ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China continue to exert a significant influence on market sentiment. While both countries had agreed to temporarily slash tariff rates, uncertainties persist regarding the long-term prospects of these agreements. Recent comments from President Trump hinting at a potential nuclear deal with Iran caused a notable tumble in oil prices, reflecting how geopolitical factors can swiftly impact commodity markets.</p>

<p>The impact of tariffs is becoming increasingly evident on corporate bottom lines and consumer prices. Walmart, despite beating earnings expectations, warned that it would be forced to raise prices due to tariffs, underscoring the potential for inflationary pressures to build. This announcement triggered a decline in Walmart's stock price, highlighting investor sensitivity to trade-related challenges.</p>

<h2>Economic Data and Federal Reserve Outlook</h2>

<p>Economic data released on Thursday offered a mixed picture. Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell in April, driven by a decline in service prices. This soft inflation report contributed to a decrease in Treasury yields, providing some support to the overall stock market. However, retail sales data revealed a slowdown in spending, potentially linked to the impact of tariffs on consumer behavior.</p>

<p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated concerns about economic uncertainty and the potential for "supply shocks," suggesting a cautious approach to monetary policy. Powell's remarks reinforced the Federal Reserve's focus on monitoring incoming data to assess the state of the economy, highlighting the central bank's sensitivity to both inflation and economic growth.</p>

<h2>Corporate News and Stock Movements</h2>

<p>Several significant corporate developments impacted individual stock prices and sector performance. The following is a summary of the news and stock movements:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>UnitedHealth Group</b> shares plunged after the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reported a Department of Justice investigation into the insurer's Medicare Advantage business practices. UnitedHealth denied being notified of the investigation.</li>
<li><b>Meta Platforms</b> stock slipped following a report that the company plans to delay the rollout of its premier "Behemoth" large language model, raising concerns about the company's artificial intelligence initiatives.</li>
<li><b>CoreWeave</b>, an Nvidia-backed cloud services provider, saw its stock pop despite a downgrade from D.A. Davidson. The downgrade came despite a revenue beat, with the analyst citing concerns about the company's returns and scalability.</li>
<li><b>Pinterest</b> received an upgrade from Wolfe Research, citing easing tariff tensions between the U.S. and China and a reasonable valuation.</li>
<li><b>Foot Locker</b> shares soared after Dick's Sporting Goods announced an acquisition of the company. Dick's shares, on the other hand, were down.</li>
<li><b>Petrobras</b> was upgraded by Jefferies, who cited new cost-cutting measures.</li>
<li><b>Cisco Systems</b> rose after reporting earnings.</li>
</ul>

<p>The retail sector showed considerable volatility, with Foot Locker's acquisition by Dick's Sporting Goods dominating headlines. However, the deal raises concerns about the broader retail environment.</p>

<h2>Recession Fears</h2>
<p> Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan also weighed in on Thursday and said that while it was not
    a foregone conclusion, a recession in the US economy was still 'on the table' and should be considered a possibility.
</p>

<p>Overall, Thursday's market activity reflected a delicate balancing act between positive economic signals, such as low inflation and signs of trade truces, and persistent concerns about trade tensions, corporate performances and the possibility of an economic recession.
