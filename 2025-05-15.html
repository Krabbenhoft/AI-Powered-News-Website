    <h1>May 15, 2025: Economic Uncertainty Amid Tariff Impacts and Geopolitical Tensions</h1>

    <p>
        Thursday, May 15, 2025, saw a mixed performance in the U.S. stock market as investors grappled with a confluence of economic data, corporate announcements, and geopolitical developments.
        The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> managed to gain, while the <b>Nasdaq Composite</b> snapped a six-day winning streak, reflecting ongoing uncertainty.
        This volatility stemmed from several key factors, including the impact of tariffs, inflation concerns, and potential shifts in U.S. foreign policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Economic Data and Inflation</h2>

    <p>
        Economic data released on Thursday painted a complex picture of the U.S. economy.
        Notably, retail sales slowed sharply in April, reversing the pre-tariff spending burst seen in March.
        This slowdown suggests that American consumers are beginning to feel the pinch of tariffs, which have led to increased prices on certain goods.
        Walmart, one of America's largest retailers, confirmed this trend, announcing that it would be raising prices due to tariffs, despite its efforts to absorb some of the cost pressures.
        The company's CEO, Doug McMillon, stated that the magnitude of the tariffs made it impossible to avoid passing some of the costs on to customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Adding to the complexity, wholesale inflation unexpectedly slowed last month.
        This seemingly positive development was tempered by warnings from the Institute for Supply Management, which reported that a significant majority of manufacturers plan to pass on price increases to buyers.
        These conflicting signals left investors uncertain about the future trajectory of inflation, a key factor influencing Federal Reserve policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Federal Reserve Policy and Economic Outlook</h2>

    <p>
        The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring incoming economic data to assess the state of the economy.
        Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this stance on Thursday, warning of broad economic uncertainty and the potential for more frequent "supply shocks" and volatile inflation.
        These remarks suggest that the Fed is prepared to adjust its monetary policy as needed to maintain price stability and full employment, but that the path forward remains unclear.
        Economists are divided on whether the U.S. is headed for a recession, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stating that he "wouldn't take it off the table," despite the temporary trade truce with China.
    </p>

    <h2>Trade and Tariffs</h2>

    <p>
        Trade policy continues to be a significant driver of market sentiment.
        While investors initially cheered the U.S.-China trade truce, concerns remain about the long-term impact of tariffs.
        Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas for UBS Global Wealth Management, pointed out that the U.S. effective tariff rate remains significantly higher than it was at the start of the year, even after the recent reductions.
        This elevated tariff rate could slow the U.S. economy and push up prices, leading to further market volatility.
    </p>

    <p>
        President Trump's trade policies have been a major point of discussion. Historically, tariffs have been used as a tool to protect domestic industries and exert pressure on trading partners.
        However, the current situation involves a complex web of trade relationships and potential repercussions for consumers and businesses.
    </p>

    <h2>Geopolitical Tensions and Oil Prices</h2>

    <p>
        Geopolitical tensions also played a role in Thursday's market movements.
        Oil prices tumbled after President Trump hinted at progress in negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.
        A potential deal could lead to increased oil supply, putting downward pressure on prices.
        This development underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the impact of foreign policy decisions on commodity prices.
    </p>

    <h2>Individual Stock Performances</h2>

    <p>
        Several individual stocks experienced notable movements on Thursday:

            <li><b>Walmart</b> shares fell slightly after the company announced it would raise prices due to tariffs.</li>
