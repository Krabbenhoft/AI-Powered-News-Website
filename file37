   Millions of dollars in previously awarded federal grants intended for
   arts and cultural groups across the country are being canceled by the
   Trump administration, according to a National Endowment for the
   Humanities (NEH) senior official who spoke on the condition of
   anonymity because they're not authorized to speak publicly.

   The funds had been awarded by the agency through a competitive
   application process and, according to the official, covered grants from
   fiscal years 2021-2025. The official said that "no upcoming awards"
   will be made in fiscal year 2025.

   The official said Acting NEH Chair Michael McDonald told senior staff
   that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a team within the
   executive branch dedicated to reducing government spending, "wants to
   claw back $175 million" in grant money that has not yet been disbursed.
   It is not clear if that is the true amount of undisbursed funds, or an
   estimation by DOGE staff.

   On Monday, DOGE told NEH staff that it would lay off a substantial
   number of employees and cut its grant programs, as first [67]reported
   by The New York Times.

   The NEH has not responded to a request for comment.

   Groups are affected in all 50 states

   Among the thousands of groups affected by the sudden cessation of funds
   are state humanities councils, museums, historic sites, archives,
   libraries, educators and media outlets in all 50 states.

   A "Notice of Grant Termination" that was sent to a state humanities
   council and obtained by NPR states, "Your grant no longer effectuates
   the agency's needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant Agreement
   and is subject to termination." The letter continues, "Your grant's
   immediate termination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the
   federal government, including its fiscal priorities."

   The humanities are about helping "preserve community history and
   identity," said Stephen Kidd, executive director of the [74]National
   Humanities Alliance, a national umbrella organization supporting the
   humanities. Kidd said he's heard from multiple recipients of Humanities
   grants who told him they received the letter late last night.

   "We don't know the full scope of the impact of last night's actions,"
   Kidd said. "We do know that it is affecting the state humanities
   councils which are crucial to the vitality of humanities across the
   country. This is funding that was appropriated by Congress to the state
   affiliates of the NEH. This is funding that has been promised to the
   states that is now being withdrawn."

   Nearly half (42%) of the federal humanities endowment goes directly to
   state humanities councils.

   Chuck Holmes, executive director of the [75]Alabama Humanities Alliance
   and a former NPR senior editor who left the organization in 2016,
   confirmed receiving the letter. He said the Alliance, which serves
   roughly a quarter million Alabamians, was granted $1.2 million in
   federal funds for fiscal year 2024. While it varies from year to year,
   Holmes said federal dollars represent roughly 65% of its overall
   budget. The rest comes largely from state government funding and
   private sources.

   State humanities councils customarily regrant NEH money to local
   organizations including libraries, museums, historical societies,
   documentary filmmakers and others.

   Holmes said, since January, he and his staff have been "worried about
   what might happen given what has happened at the Kennedy Center and
   [Institute of Museum and Library Services] and word got out that a DOGE
   team was at the NEH."

   President Trump fired the Kennedy Center's president and board chair as
   well as Democratic appointees to the board and [79]eliminated its
   social impact division. The entire IMLS staff was [80]placed on
   administrative leave.

   "We have reserve funds that will help us get through the next few
   months," said Holmes, "Without federal funding we'll have to make
   drastic cuts to our programs."

Correction April 3, 2025

   An earlier version of this story said that state arts councils are
   affected by the cessation of funds. It is humanities councils that are
   affected.
