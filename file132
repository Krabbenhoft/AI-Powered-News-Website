   [199]March 18, 2025  This week we're talking with the one and only
   George Lopez. He joins us to talk about how he and his daughter Mayan
   approached creating their sitcom Lopez vs Lopez. He also opens up about
   his upbringing and the relationship he had with his grandparents who
   raised him. He also gets into how his comedy style has changed over the
   years since he first performed on The Tonight Show in the nineties.
