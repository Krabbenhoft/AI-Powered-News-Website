<h1>US Economy Contracts, Trump's Trade War Fuels Market Turmoil</h1>

<p>April 30, 2025, was a day of significant economic news, primarily centered on a contraction of the U.S. economy in the first quarter, ongoing trade tensions fueled by President Donald Trump's policies, and the resultant market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw some recovery, rising over 100 points, but the S&P 500 still closed out a third consecutive losing month, underscoring the turbulent conditions for investors.</p>

<p>The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy contracted for the first time in three years, citing an unexpected surge in imports as companies rushed to get ahead of impending Trump tariffs. This increase in imports, up a staggering 41% in the last quarter, skewed the economic figures and masked underlying issues. Other contributing factors to the economic downturn included a slowdown in consumer spending and a decline in government expenditures partly attributed to Elon Musk's DOGE spending cuts, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

<p>President Trump, defending his economic policies, immediately blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic downturn. He dismissed any connection between the GDP contraction and his tariffs, urging Americans to "BE PATIENT!!!" and claiming his policies "will take a while" to take effect. Trump emphasized his belief that companies would start moving into the USA in record numbers due to the tariffs, ultimately leading to a boom.</p>

<p>Market analysts have expressed concern over the President’s continued trade war. Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at Global X ETFs, noted the high levels of uncertainty for businesses and investors due to the “continual sequence of policy reversals”. He described the GDP report as a warning sign for the administration, adding that the administration’s willingness to inflict economic pain in pursuit of long-term goals was underestimated. Despite the negative GDP print, some economists urge caution against drawing immediate conclusions, noting two more GDP estimates are due that could provide a clearer picture. </p>

<p>Adding to the economic unease, ADP reported that private payroll growth slowed to 62,000 in April, the smallest gain since July 2024. This slowdown is seen as a potential impact of the Trump tariffs, creating heightened uncertainty for businesses and affecting hiring plans.

<p>The energy sector, in particular, faced its worst April on record, with the sector sliding more than 3% in midday trading. Every stock in the sector was on pace to end the month in the red, signaling widespread concern about the impact of trade-related demand shocks on the global economy.</p>

<p>Despite the overall market volatility, the artificial intelligence (AI) sector remained robust. Jed Ellerbroek of Argent Capital Management stated the AI trade is still intact, reaffirming the promise of AI tools and capabilities, even with tariff threats and global trade tensions. He noted that some companies are seeing as much as 30% of their code written by AI, showing continued advancement and impact of the sector.</p>

<p>On the company-specific front, Etsy gained after a revenue beat and noted it's "staying nimble in the face of uncertainty" regarding tariffs, while Oddity Tech saw its shares soar after an earnings beat and raised its earnings and revenue forecast, saying the tariff headwinds were "expected to be manageable." Warby Parker was upgraded to a neutral rating by Citi, suggesting that the market has already priced in near-term tariff pressures on the stock.</p>

<p>As the market navigated these economic complexities, live cattle futures hit an all-time high, signaling potential bad news for consumers planning cookouts. Starbucks stock, on the other hand, dropped 7% after reporting a fifth straight quarter of declining U.S. sales.</p>
