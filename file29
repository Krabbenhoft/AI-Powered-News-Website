   When [81]President Trump announced his latest tariffs on Wednesday, he
   also ignited an economic mystery. Just where in the world did those
   numbers come from?

   Holding up a sign on the White House lawn, Trump pointed to a new, 34%
   tax on imports from China; for the EU, a tax of 20%. Vietnam got 46%;
   India, 26%. Nigeria? Just 15 percent. Trump claimed that these
   "reciprocal" tariffs reflect how other countries already tax American
   products. "That means they do it to us and we do it to them," he said.
   "Very simple."

   That is not true. These are not reciprocal tariffs. They do not
   correspond to the tariff rates in other countries. The truth behind
   where these tariffs came from is far more interesting.

[83]Trump unveils 10% tariff on all imports and 'reciprocal' tariffs dozens
of economies

   On Wednesday night, the administration revealed how they calculated the
   new tariffs, which are the highest taxes on foreign products that
   America has seen in generations. (For a sense of that era, listen to
   the [84]Planet Money episode on the Smoot-Hawley tariffs.)

   Buried in that math, finally, is a straightforward answer to a question
   that Trump has long refused to straightforwardly answer: How much will
   his tariffs raise prices?

Diving deep into Trump's tariff math

   This is [85]the Trump administration's tariff formula, as revealed on
   Wednesday night by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative :
   The Trump administration’s tariff formula.

   Behind these Greek letters there's a blunt but understandable approach.
   Essentially, the equation is trying to answer the question: How high
   should we set tariffs in order to get Americans to buy fewer foreign
   products, and close the trade deficit? This math says, the more of a
   trade deficit the U.S. has with another country, the higher that
   tariffs should be on that country's products.

   Take China for instance. Last year, Americans imported about $439
   billion of products from China — chiefly electronics, clothing, and
   machinery — while exporting only $144 billion. According to this
   formula, a 67% tax on those Chinese products should correct this trade
   imbalance. (On Wednesday Trump announced that the actual tariff would
   only be half of that, or 34%.)

   Here's how Trump's math says it would work: The 67% tax should raise
   the prices of Chinese products in the United States. And those higher
   prices should discourage Americans from buying Chinese products or
   products that contain Chinese components.

   This is contrary to Trump's previous public statements, where he has
   variously denied that tariffs would raise prices or has said that he
   "couldn't care less."

   But according to Trump's math, the tariffs are supposed to raise
   prices. Because those higher prices are the driving force that will
   close the trade deficit.

   There are a couple of major assumptions in Trump's math. The biggest
   assumption involves how much the tariffs would cause prices to go up.
   Here, the administration makes an eyebrow-raising admission: It guesses
   that for every 10% hike in tariffs, there will be a 2.5% increase in
   prices.

   Translation: Trump's economists think that about a quarter of his
   tariffs will be passed onto American consumers in the form of higher
   prices.

   Going back to the China example, here's how it would all play out.
   According to Trump's math, the 67% tariff on Chinese products would
   cause prices of those products to go up by 16.75%.

   By coincidence, the administration also assumes that for every 10%
   increase in the price of foreign products, there will be a 40% decrease
   in how much Americans buy. (This is on the higher but still reasonable
   end of what mainstream economists believe.) So, faced with 16.75%
   higher prices, Trump expects Americans to decrease their purchases by
   four times that amount. Which brings us back to 67%.

[89]Trump tariffs spark ire and dismay from international leaders

   In other words, a 67% tariff on Chinese products would reduce demand
   for Chinese products by … also 67%. So if Americans are currently
   buying $439 billion worth of Chinese products each year, Trump's
   economists expect that the new tariffs will reduce that spending by
   $294 billion — which would close the trade deficit. At least in theory.

What's wrong with Trump's tariff math?

   Certainly these new tariffs are not "reciprocal" tariffs. But the math
   behind them is not wholly invented or nonsensical, despite what some
   [90]online have claimed.

   Sponsor Message

   In fact, for possibly the first time ever, the administration is
   explicitly acknowledging some of the basic economic logic of tariffs.
   Tariffs do raise prices. And higher prices do cause people to buy less
   stuff. And if Americans buy less foreign stuff, then America's trade
   deficit with other countries will narrow.

   But that's not to say that any of Trump's tariff calculations arrive at
   the right answer. For one, these are very rough, back-of-the-envelope
   calculations. As laid out, this formula treats every trading partner,
   every good and every industry the same. Bananas, oil, clothing,
   computers or cars — it doesn't matter what a country sends to the U.S.

   More importantly, the formula hinges on a big assumption about how much
   tariffs will raise prices. Trump's math assumes that only a quarter of
   the tariffs would be passed onto American consumers in the form of
   higher prices. But economists who have studied Trump's tariffs in 2018
   — on steel and aluminum and various products from China — calculate
   that [91]almost all of those tariffs ended up being passed onto
   Americans.

   Aside from that, Trump's tariff math also ignores the broader economic
   consequences of these sweeping new tariffs. They will have an effect on
   the overall American economy. They will influence exchange rates. And
   they will likely provoke retaliatory tariffs from other countries.

   So, will Trump's new tariffs actually close the trade deficit? Maybe,
   maybe not. But finally, at least, the administration has shown its
   work. And according to their calculations, raising prices and closing
   the trade deficit is what these tariffs are designed to do.
