19 states sue over Trump's voting executive order, arguing it's
unconstitutional

   Nineteen states are suing over President Donald Trump's [63]sweeping
   executive order on voting that he signed last week, saying it is "an
   unconstitutional attempt to seize control of elections" that will
   create barriers to voting that could disenfranchise millions.

   The [64]lawsuit, which is the fourth legal challenge so far against the
   executive order, calls on a federal district court in Massachusetts to
   block several provisions of the executive order, which the attorneys
   general argue "usurps the States' constitutional power and seeks to
   amend election law by fiat."

   The lawsuit is filed by Democratic attorneys general from Arizona,
   California, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois,
   Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New
   Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

[67]Trump seeks to mandate proof of citizenship in voter registration

   "We are a democracy — not a monarchy — and this Executive Order is an
   authoritarian power grab," said New York Attorney General Letitia James
   in a statement. "With this Order, this President is prioritizing his
   own quest for unchecked power above the rights and will of the public."

   Trump's March 25 order seeks to make dramatic changes to voting and
   election administration and threatens that if states do not comply they
   could lose federal funds and face potential action from the U.S.
   attorney general.

   Among the changes, the executive order directs the Election Assistance
   Commission – an independent, bipartisan body — to rewrite the federal
   voter registration form to include a requirement that Americans must
   show a copy of a proof of citizenship document to register to vote in
   federal races. It also aims to prevent states from counting mailed
   ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after the
   election, which [68]18 states currently allow.

   The lawsuit argues that these changes cannot be ordered by a president,
   since it is up to states and Congress to decide how elections should be
   run. It also argues the president cannot direct the Election Assistance
   Commission to take actions since it is an independent body, and that
   adding a proof of citizenship requirement on the federal registration
   form conflicts with existing federal law.

   The suit says the executive order "sows confusion and sets the stage
   for chaos" since states will have to divert staff and resources toward
   implementing new training, testing, voter education and coordination
   "at breakneck pace" to comply with the order – or risk losing needed
   funds if they don't comply.

   Three other federal lawsuits have already been filed this week against
   the executive order. All are assigned to U.S. District Court Judge
   Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C. who ordered Thursday that
   the three suits will be consolidated and will proceed together.

   Two of those lawsuits were brought by voting rights groups on behalf of
   organizations that assist voters with registration. The other was
   brought by Democratic election attorney Marc Elias' law firm on behalf
   of Democrats.

   Trump has said his executive order is necessary to stop fraud and
   "straighten out our elections."

   False claims about election fraud have become part of Trump's brand,
   the most notable example being his denial of his 2020 election loss.

   In the leadup to the 2024 election, Trump [69]promoted the bogus theory
   that Democrats would attempt to steal the election by helping
   noncitizens vote in large numbers. There is no evidence of such a plot.
   [70]An early voting site is seen in Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday.
   Ahead of this year's general election, Donald Trump and Republican
   allies have zeroed in on the baseless claim that Democrats are
   encouraging newly arrived migrants to vote for them.

[72]How Republicans mainstreamed the baseless idea of noncitizen voting in
2024

   In fact, past audits have shown that cases of noncitizens voting
   [73]are rare. Under current federal law, voters must attest, under
   penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens when they register to
   vote, and some states take additional steps to verify citizenship.
   Those who try to vote illegally can face prison time and deportation.

[76]6 facts about false noncitizen voting claims and the election

   Still, in response to the lawsuit filed by Democrats challenging the
   executive order, U.S. Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, [77]posted to X, "Why
   are top Democrats suing to allow non-citizens to vote in American
   elections? You know why." Billionaire Elon Musk, who owns X and is a
   top adviser to Trump, [78]shared Lee's post with one word, "Fraud."

   The lawsuits challenging the executive order argue that requiring
   voters to show a copy of a proof of citizenship document to register to
   vote would create an unlawful burden on voters, and conflicts with the
   1993 federal law, the National Voter Registration Act, that spells out
   registration requirements.

   More than 21 million American adults [79]do not have a proof of
   citizenship document like a birth certificate or passport, or do not
   have easy access to one, according to a survey commissioned by voting
   rights advocates. Furthermore, Trump's executive order only names a
   limited number of documents that can be used to prove citizenship: a
   U.S. passport, military ID cards that state citizenship, or a
   government-issued photo ID that lists citizenship, though most states
   do not offer IDs that list citizenship. It remains unclear if birth
   certificates are a valid way to prove citizenship under the executive
   order. Only half of Americans have a passport.

   Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are [83]backing federal legislation
   that will change federal law to require proof of citizenship to
   register to vote. Republican House leaders said in a [84]statement on
   Monday that the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, known as the
   SAVE Act, "cements into law President Trump's executive action to
   secure our voter registration process and protect the voices of
   American voters."
   [85]Potential young voters get information at a voter registration desk
   at California State University, Los Angeles, on Oct. 22, 2024. The
   Republican-backed SAVE Act would add documentary proof-of-citizenship
   requirements to voter registration.
