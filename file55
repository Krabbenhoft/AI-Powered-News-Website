   The unique genetic change that turned horses into athletic powerhouses
   A new study suggests genetic changes allow horses to produce more
   energy, while minimizing the toll the energy takes on cells.

The unique genetic change that turned horses into athletic powerhouses

   Horses are exceptional athletes, able to push their large bodies
   further and faster than many other animals.

   Gianni Castiglione did not set out to study horses.

   The Vanderbilt University biologist and his colleagues were interested
   in how different animal species balance the need to produce energy with
   the harmful byproducts of that production.

   "To make energy, we've made a deal with the devil to, basically, have a
   slow burning fire in our cells," he said. That fire essentially burns
   oxygen to create energy. But that kicks up a lot of smoke, or oxidative
   stress, that can harm cells.

   Horses, it turns out, have evolved an unusual way of regulating this
   tradeoff that allows them to [72]produce more energy without incurring
   more cellular damage, researchers report in the journal Science. Those
   genetic changes may, in part, explain how horses became such powerful
   athletes, able to [73]outrun and outlast virtually all other animals.

   "Horses can make this fire burn even hotter and make the damage even
   less than it would be in a species like a human," said Castiglione.

   The changes occurred in a key gene pathway called NRF2/KEAP1. The
   pathway senses the buildup of oxidative stress and then kickstarts
   antioxidant production, which can clean it up, said Castiglione. "This
   is essentially the energy production and fire department, all wrapped
   in one."

   Castiglione and his colleagues were scanning the genomes of nearly 200
   mammalian species looking for unusual variants in this pathway. Horses
   stuck out with a single, highly unusual mutation.

   "It's a type of mutation called a nonsense mutation," he said. "That's
   because it breaks a gene, it inactivates it from doing what the cell
   needs it to do." It basically put a stop sign, called a stop codon,
   toward the beginning of the KEAP1 gene. Stop codons generally signal
   where a gene ends, so having one at the start would "break" the gene.

   This mutation kills mice, probably because it allows too much "smoke"
   to build up in cells. So Castiglione was stumped. "We thought, wow, how
   are horses dealing with this?"

   Through a variety of genomic and molecular techniques, the researchers
   found an answer.

   "Horses have evolved a very intricate strategy for working around this
   stop codon," said Elia Duh, a study co-author and molecular biologist
   at Johns Hopkins University. Essentially, a suite of mutations allows
   them to ignore the stop sign, making the gene work, but in a slightly
   different way that ends up benefiting the horses.

   The researchers found that these mutations, which arose in the
   ancestors of all modern horses, allow their muscle cells to produce up
   to five times more energy than mouse cells, while simultaneously
   ramping up their damage-control system by 200%.

   "This provides them with the biochemical means to run fast and over
   long distances," said Duh. This ultimately helps them become aerobic
   powerhouses.

   "I really love this paper," said Samantha Brooks, a horse genetics
   researcher at the University of Florida. The mutation, she said,
   "should have caused a catastrophic loss of function for this protein.
   But instead, the ancestors of these species somehow managed to really
   turn that lemon into lemonade."

   The way they made lemonade — ignoring a stop codon — has only
   previously been reported in viruses, the researchers say.

   This adaptation could have implications for human health. Many
   inherited diseases, like [74]cystic fibrosis and[75] muscular
   dystrophy, stem from stop codons arising in important genes. If
   researchers can better understand how horses manage to ignore such stop
   codons, said Duh, perhaps they could develop gene therapies that do
   just that in humans, too.
