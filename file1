   U.S. national security officials for a bombing campaign against Houthi
   fighters in Yemen, because a journalist was added to their Signal group
   chat. That bombing campaign is ongoing and we havenʼt heard much about
   how it is going or its goals. Our national security correspondent tells
   us about what the U.S. military is doing in Yemen and how weʼre getting
   more information about that from the Houthis than from the Pentagon.
