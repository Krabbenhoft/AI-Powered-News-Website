Microsoft turns 50: A look back at everything from the Altair to the Zune

   It all started with two kids who shared a geeky hobby.

   Growing up in Seattle, childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen were
   obsessed with an emerging industry called computing. As teenagers, they
   haunted the University of Washington's computer lab, the only place
   they could get their hands on the technology that so fascinated them.
   [62]Bill Gates at NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., February 5,
   2025.

[63]Interview highlights

[64]Bill Gates reflects on his youth, beginnings of Microsoft, in new memoir

   By 1971, they'd taken so many liberties with the lab's equipment that
   its director [65]sent Allen a letter demanding he turn in his key.
   Little did Allen know that in 2017, he'd read that letter aloud to a
   crowd gathered to celebrate the dedication of a new computer science
   school in his name.

   By then, Gates and Allen had accomplished their goal of helping put a
   computer on every desk and in every home, laying the foundation for the
   digital technology that has since proliferated into every corner of our
   lives. They called their company Microsoft, and it led the personal
   computing revolution.

Revenge of the hobbyists

   In 1975, the two friends were in their twenties: Gates was studying at
   Harvard and Allen had dropped out of college to take a job at
   Honeywell. Allen had a lightbulb moment that would change their lives —
   and ours — when he spotted [66]an ad on the cover of Popular
   Electronics. It was for a build-it-yourself computer called an Altair
   8800.

   A company called MITS sold the computer as a kit. An Altair was about
   the size of an apple crate, with no screen, just lights and switches on
   the front. You'd program it by punching holes into paper.

   Allen wondered if he and his friend could create a programming language
   for it.

   Allen "went running to Bill and said, 'We have to catch this train,'"
   said Ed Lazowska, a computer science professor and Bill and Melinda
   Gates chair emeritus at the Allen School at the University of
   Washington. "The rest is history."

   Together, they built something called an "interpreter," which would
   tell the computer how to execute commands from the user. They offered
   to license the program to MITS, which could sell it along with the
   kits. MITS said yes. They were in business.

   Allen and Gates moved to Albuquerque to work with MITS, forming an
   informal partnership called "Micro-soft." Their program for the Altair
   became Microsoft BASIC — think of it as the root of all their software
   that was to come.

   Microsoft wasn't the only company that was creating programming.
   Computer makers did, too, although sometimes it was just simple binary.
   The problem was, computer makers often wrote programs that only worked
   for specific machines. They couldn't be used on other devices.
   Microsoft's big idea was to make programming that worked on many models
   and could be sold separately.

   The notion that software itself had value was novel — so much so that
   Gates had to [67]write a letter to fellow hobbyists begging them to
   stop pirating it. "As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of
   you steal your software," Gates wrote in 1976. "Hardware must be paid
   for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who
   worked on it get paid?"

   According to Lazowska, this was a seminal moment for the fledgling
   software industry. "The notion that software had value really stems
   from that letter that Bill wrote to hobbyists," he said. "Of course,
   these days we think software is the value, in many ways. That's where
   the creativity arises more than anywhere else. That's one of the many
   things Microsoft brought to the world. It's the software industry."

   Back in the 1970s, the new industry was facing a big limitation: a
   small pool of customers. Computers mainly belonged to kit hobbyists —
   the early adopters who Gates was trying to persuade to become paying
   customers — or to the academic and business institutions that could
   afford much more powerful room-sized mainframes.

   "When Microsoft was launched, digital technology was in universities
   and major companies in multimillion dollar computers, locked in big air
   conditioned rooms," Lazowska said.

   But Gates and Allen had a moonshot idea: To put a computer on every
   desk. Running Microsoft software, of course.

   "Now, digital technology is absolutely everywhere, and that's the
   transformation," said Lazowska. Today, he says, computing is so
   omnipresent — it's the phone in your pocket, the watch on your wrist,
   the laptop you use for everything — that we barely think about it. "In
   many ways, it's the vision of Bill and Paul that drove that
   transformation," he said.

The PC boom

   Most people learned of Microsoft's next big innovation because it came
   preinstalled on the first home computers IBM rolled out in the early
   80s. It was called the Microsoft Disk Operating System — MS-DOS, for
   short.

   In a shrewd business move, Gates and Allen made sure they could license
   MS-DOS to any computer manufacturer, not just IBM. That non-exclusivity
   deal helped Microsoft software take over the world.

   MS-DOS was groundbreaking, but it wasn't exactly user-friendly by
   today's standards.

   At a recent vintage computer festival in Seattle, Michael Brutman
   booted it up on an early PC. "The DOS environment is very minimal," he
   said. Really minimal. Just a black screen where you type in commands
   listed in a two-inch thick manual, which he also had on display.

   Still, the advent of the PC — short for personal computer — meant that
   ordinary people were learning how to type those commands. Even if they
   didn't work for a major research university or corporation, they might
   encounter a PC in their school or office.

   " If you used an IBM PC, Microsoft was there," Brutman said.

   Microsoft's next step into the desktop world was even bigger. Enter
   [68]Windows.

[71]A Surprise Ambient Jam ... From Windows 95

   Instead of typing commands, Windows allowed users to navigate by
   pointing and clicking on colorful, intuitively-named icons. Microsoft
   didn't invent the graphic operating system, but it did make it cheaper
   and more widely available — and that really helped personal computers
   take off.

   For University of Washington tech historian and author Margaret O'Mara,
   two things come to mind when she thinks back on Microsoft's greatest
   hits: " I immediately think of Windows and Office," she said. "I think
   of the system that by the end of the 1990s was running on nearly every
   single desktop computer in the world."

   That system introduced household names we still use today: Word,
   PowerPoint, Excel. The idea that applications could be used across
   industries and parts of society was something new.

   "Software was a tool you could use in your home, in your school and in
   your office," O'Mara said. "These were no longer separate things."

Attempts to reboot

   By now, Microsoft's moonshot was a success. The company did get a PC on
   every desk — running Microsoft software. Now it needed a new frontier.

   Microsoft was a software company, but by the early 2000s, its top
   rivals were scoring big wins in hardware. Apple built its devices
   in-house, giving the company more control and a product that was often
   sleeker and easier to use. Its [72]iPod and [73]iPhone were the
   superstars of the mobile technology world.

[76]Microsoft's Zune Bids for Piece of iPod's Turf

   Microsoft's attempts to compete — like [77]the Zune, its 2006 ill-fated
   answer to the iPod — didn't pan out. Likewise, the Windows Phone and
   [78]the Kin, Microsoft's 2010 forays into smartphones, were a bust.

   But one of the company's big hardware reinvention efforts paid off.
   Microsoft branched out to become a gaming company, driven by the wild
   success of the [79]Xbox video game console, which debuted in 2001. Hit
   games like Halo gave it unique appeal, and the idea to let gamers play
   together over the internet on Xbox Live set the gaming system apart.

   Today, the company is reinventing itself yet again. Microsoft Azure,
   its cloud computing platform, has been a big revenue driver. The
   company uses its vast network of data centers to sell technology
   services to other businesses, many of which are adopting artificial
   intelligence applications and need cloud computing to run them.

   Microsoft, too, is betting heavily on artificial intelligence. With its
   partner OpenAI, Microsoft has [80]built ChatGPT into its Bing search
   engine. Microsoft is also increasingly outfitting Windows and Office
   products with Copilot, its in-house AI software.

   "The company's ability to reinvent itself is remarkable, and that's
   pretty unusual," Lazowska said. "Many companies just keep riding the
   same horse and don't change — and eventually fade away."
