   ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

   Today, the U.S. Education Department set a - sent a letter warning
   schools, get rid of DEI programs or lose federal funds that help
   low-income students. It's the administration's latest move to make
   public schools comply with President Trump's interpretation of civil
   rights laws. NPR education reporter Jonaki Mehta has been following
   this. Hey, Jonaki.

   JONAKI MEHTA, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.

   SHAPIRO: So this letter from the ED Department went to state leaders
   across the country. What did it say?

   MEHTA: So part of what the letter said was, quote, 'the use of
   diversity, equity and inclusion programs to take advantage - to
   advantage one's race over another is impermissible." And what's at
   stake here is known as Title 1 funding. It's money aimed at low-income
   students and is one of the biggest grants the ED Department oversees.
   In the current fiscal year, the federal government set aside $18
   billion for Title 1 money, and that serves nearly 90% of school
   districts around the country.

   SHAPIRO: And what do states have to do to comply with this new
   directive?

   MEHTA: Yeah, so the memo today included a certification letter that
   state and local leaders have to sign and get back to the ED Department
   within 10 days to prove they're complying with civil rights law in a
   way that the department seems to be defining them. And if they don't,
   Title 1 funding could be at risk.

   SHAPIRO: And how is the Education Department defining those civil
   rights laws?

   MEHTA: Yeah, they haven't provided a clear definition, but the
   department's acting assistant secretary of civil rights Craig Trainor
   said in a statement today that they have seen many schools violate
   civil rights law, quote, "including by using DEI programs to
   discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another based on
   identity characteristics." And in recent weeks, the administration
   released a document that helped to clarify what it means by DEI. Like,
   one example they said was schools can observe historic events like
   Black History Month, but only so long as they don't exclude any
   students. So, you know, if an event was limited just to Black students,
   that would be considered a violation by this administration.

   And one thing I'll point out is, the whole idea behind certain federal
   grants like Title 1 and those for students with disabilities, is
   they're actually supposed to be targeted at specific groups of
   students. Like, a lot of disability advocates have expressed concerns
   that special ed programs could get tied up in what the administration
   defines as DEI.

   SHAPIRO: What are school leaders saying about this?

   MEHTA: Yeah, the letter was issued this morning, so state and local
   leaders are still digesting the news, including Peter Livingston, who I
   spoke to. He's a superintendent of Lucerne Valley Unified in
   California's High Desert. It's a rural district that serves a student
   population that's considered 90% economically disadvantaged.

   PETER LIVINGSTON: That's a big part of our budget that we use to serve
   our kids, so it's needed. If the regulations are in place that we have
   to follow, that's what we'd be doing in order to ensure that we have
   the money to serve our students.

   MEHTA: Livingston said his district uses Title 1 for things like hiring
   staff and academic programs that he says help level the playing field
   for students regardless of their family's income. Now, federal grants
   do have some strings attached, but largely it's up to districts to
   decide how to use the money to meet the needs of their students. And
   Livingston is actually hopeful that even less of a role from the
   federal government will mean more control for districts like his.

   LIVINGSTON: If it's done strategically at the federal level, I -
   personally, I think it would free up more federal money that could come
   directly to districts.

   MEHTA: And other school leaders we've spoken to have expressed concerns
   about the administration threatening to cut federal funding. And
   recently, the American Federation of Teachers and other education
   groups sued to block the ED Department from enforcing some other recent
   related civil rights guidance.

   SHAPIRO: How does this letter fit in with other actions the
   administration has taken affecting school funding?

   MEHTA: Yeah, so this letter is just about Title 1 funds, but overall,
   the federal government provides about 10% of the money that goes to
   schools, and the rest comes from state and local governments. But in
   the case of rural schools and low-income schools, they really rely more
   heavily on federal money. Also, this letter is not the first one aimed
   at cutting school funding. Just a few days ago, the ED Department sent
   a notice to state leaders saying they were no longer going to reimburse
   states for COVID relief money that they were still spending or had
   recently spent. And that sent state leaders scrambling 'cause many are
   still expecting to be paid back by the feds.

   SHAPIRO: NPR education reporter Jonaki Mehta. Thanks a lot.

   MEHTA: Thank you, Ari.
