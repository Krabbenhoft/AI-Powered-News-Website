   Liquid eggs recalled over bleach concerns Over 200,000 pounds of Egg
   Beaters and Bob Evans products were recalled over potential cleaning
   solution contamination. The USDA says that health risks are low, but
   consumers should still steer clear.

Popular brands of liquid eggs are recalled over bleach contamination concerns

   USDA Food Safety Inspection Service

   Breakfast eaters beware: Thousands of pounds of liquid egg substitutes
   from two popular brands have been recalled over contamination concerns.

   The Michigan-based company Cargill Kitchen Solutions is recalling some
   212,268 pounds of products under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans labels
   because they may contain a cleaning solution, the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) [63]announced
   last week.
   [64]Bird flu and other factors have contributed to an egg shortage
   across the country.

[65]Food

[66]With egg prices climbing, here are some cheaper — and delicious —
alternatives

   It said the four kinds of liquid egg products were shipped for
   distribution in Ohio and Texas and for food service use in Arizona,
   California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Iowa — though that may not
   be an exhaustive list.

   "There is a possibility that the products were distributed nationwide,"
   it added.

   Cargill spokesperson Kristen Saunders told NPR on Friday that the
   company had no updates about the scope of the distribution. Cargill
   said in a statement that the products "do not pose a health concern if
   consumed" and had been recalled "out of an abundance of caution."

   FSIS said it had acted on a tip about the products' potential
   contamination with sodium hypochlorite, the [67]active ingredient in
   bleach.

   Ingesting concentrated bleach products could lead to permanent
   gastrointestinal problems or even death, while lower-concentration
   household bleach can cause irritation, according to [68]Poison Control.
   But FSIS says the health risks for consumers are relatively low.
   [69]A sign on a refrigerated display case of eggs in a grocery store in
   Hailey, Idaho, advertises the price of $3.98 for 1.5 dozen cage-free
   medium eggs, compared to $13.39 elsewhere.

   "After conducting an investigation and thorough assessment of the
   contents of the cleaning solution, FSIS scientists concluded that use
   of this product should not cause adverse health consequences, or the
   risk is negligible, resulting in a Class III recall," the agency said,
   adding that there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions.

   Even so, it warns shoppers not to consume the potentially contaminated
   products. Instead, authorities say, they should throw them away or
   return them to the store.

   The recalled products, which were produced on March 12 and 13, bear the
   establishment number "G1804" on their cartons. Here's the full list:
     * 32-oz. (2-lb.) carton containing "egg beaters ORIGINAL LIQUID EGG
       SUBSTITUTE" and USE BY AUG 10 2025.
     * 32-oz. (2-lb.) carton containing "egg beaters CAGE-FREE ORIGINAL
       LIQUID EGG SUBSTITUTE" and USE BY AUG 09 2025.
     * 32-oz. (2-lb.) carton containing "egg beaters CAGE-FREE ORIGINAL
       FROZEN EGG SUBSTITUTE" and "egg beaters NO ENJAULADAS ORIGINAL
       SUSTITUTO DE HUEVO CONGELADO" and USE BY MAR 07 2026.
     * 32-oz. (2-lb.) carton containing "Bob Evans Better'n Eggs Made with
       Real Egg Whites" and USE BY AUG 10 2025.

[74]Food

[75]Yes, the number of food recalls has been rising. Here's what you need to
know

   The recall comes as many Americans are turning to egg substitutes due
   to [76]rising egg prices and supermarket shortages.

   Avian flu — and [77]efforts to contain it — have wiped out [78]millions
   of birds since last year, making eggs an increasingly hot commodity.
   Several national retailers began [79]limiting egg purchases earlier
   this year, while restaurant chains like Denny's and Waffle House added
   a [80]surcharge on egg dishes.
   [81]A customer shops for eggs at a grocery store on March 12 in
   Chicago. Wholesale egg prices are going down, but it could take several
   days before grocery prices follow suit.

[82]Business

[83]Wholesale egg prices are going down. How soon will it affect your grocery
bill?

   After hitting [84]record highs in January, egg prices seem to be on
   their way down. The USDA reported in mid-March that the national
   average wholesale price of eggs — the cost that distributors charge
   retailers — had [85]steadily declined since February, down to $4.15 per
   dozen.

   While that may be welcome news, shoppers might not want to put all the
   eggs in their basket just yet — especially with President Trump's
   [86]newest round of tariffs about to take effect.

   As economists told NPR last month, the speed at which grocery store
   prices change depends on several factors, from the state of bird flu to
   the level of consumer demand — which could see a brief bump this month
   for Easter and Passover.
