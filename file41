   BEIJING — From slapping tariffs on America's friends and foes alike, to
   the dismantling of[68] foreign aid and[69] retreat from international
   institutions, the Trump administration's actions have been criticized
   for creating a global leadership vacuum that will be filled by U.S
   rivals, especially China.

   But speaking to some of China's America watchers, views of any
   opportunities that the new administration might offer are tempered by
   caution and skepticism about China's appetite to eat America's lunch.

   In some ways, China's ambivalence about taking on greater global
   responsibilities mirrors Americans' wariness and weariness with foreign
   adventures, against the background of domestic political and economic
   woes.

[72]Trump's tariffs are so far-reaching they include several remote,
uninhabited islands

   Regardless of how Chinese observers think China should respond to any
   perceived openings or opportunities, the changes in the U.S. resonate
   on a personal level with America watchers, many of whom have lived and
   been educated in the U.S.

Is America a "beacon" or a "roulette"?

   Journalist and author[73] Zha Jianying, for example, studied at the
   University of South Carolina and Columbia University in the early
   1980s, when Beijing began allowing students to study in America.

   Zha is one of China's liberals, who used to "look up to America as a
   role model to help change China in the more democratic direction."
   Recent developments in America under the Trump administration, she
   says, "have been really shocking and bewildering and in some sense
   disillusioning."

   shelves holding photos at her home in Beijing.

   But for the Chinese state, she says, "it's definitely an opportunity,
   because what's happening in the U.S. does a better job than state
   propaganda could do to demonize America as, you know, a phony
   democracy, which really is an imperialist power."

   By contrast,[74] Wang Haolan, who was born in 1997, is one of many
   Chinese who have never seen the U.S. as a beacon. "I have never
   believed the U.S. was that great," he says. The name of his popular
   podcast,[75] The American Roulette, hints at this view.

[76]World

[77]With Trump in office, will China step up as as the world's leader?

   Unlike older Chinese, Wang did not live through the economic hardships
   and political campaigns under the rule of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Wang
   came of age during China's reform era, when the country was relatively
   open, and the economy grew rapidly.

   Wang, who researches China at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New
   York, believes that there's no need for China to be in a hurry when
   things in the U.S. are going its way.

   "As Napoleon famously said, when your enemy is making a mistake, don't
   do anything to disturb him," he says. "So I think China's strategy will
   be more of a tranquil waiting."

Will there be a deal?

   China faces an early test of how to deal with the U.S., as President
   Trump imposes tariffs in a bid to lower the U.S. trade deficit with
   China.

   "I'll be speaking to President Xi. I have a great relationship with
   him. We're going to have a very good relationship, but we have a
   trillion-dollar deficit because of Biden," Trump told reporters in the
   Oval Office on March 21.

   (The total U.S. trade deficit with China last year was in fact[78] $263
   billion, according to the Commerce Department.)

   Peking University international relations expert[79] Wang Dong, who got
   his Ph.D. in political science from UCLA, argues that Trump's playbook
   includes using tariffs to pressure countries into making deals, and if
   that doesn't work, he raises the stakes.

[80]World

[81]Trump's tariffs on China left some winners, Vietnam is one of them

   "I do think there's a window of opportunity for both sides to really
   strike a deal, which is I think three to six months," in Trump's second
   term. If that window of opportunity is gone, then Trump might be
   tempted to revert back to his more confrontational approach."

   That approach, he adds, could mean using Taiwan or other issues for
   leverage against China, which could increase the likelihood of
   conflict.

   But Wang also notes that China wants to lower its trade surplus with
   the U.S., as it seeks to shift its engines of economic growth away from
   investment, manufacturing and exporting, and toward services and
   consumption. So there may be an "overlap of interests," and, Wang says,
   a potential "opportunity that China-U.S. relations might get improved
   during Trump's second term."

A history of caution

   [82]Xie Tao, dean of the School of International Relations and
   Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, who received his Ph.D.
   from Northwestern University in 2007, also sees an opening for China.

   "Look at the dismantling of the USAID and many other foreign aid
   projects," he says. "It does appear to present an unprecedented
   opportunity for China to present its own alternative version of a just
   world."

   Xie adds that if there is an expectation for China to play a more
   active role in world affairs, Chinese leadership would not say no. But
   he also believes that China would avoid direct confrontation with the
   U.S. and avoid claims to leadership in every aspect of international
   affairs.

   This means, he says, "that you behave very cautiously on the
   international arena. You don't want to overstretch yourself. You don't
   want to make promises that you cannot fulfill."

   People's University professor of international relations[83] Shi
   Yinhong, who has been a visiting scholar at four American universities
   since the 1980s, is even more skeptical of any opportunity.

   He believes Trump is unlikely to succeed in striking grand bargains,
   judging from his failure to reach deals with, for example, North Korean
   leader Kim Jong Un in[84] 2018 and[85] 2019.
   President Trump gives North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a thumbs up at
   their meeting.

   The U.S. and China also signed a [87]deal in January 2020 to lower
   China's trade surplus with the U.S., but it quickly[88] fell apart,
   suggesting, Shi says, that China will be skeptical of any attempt by
   Trump to strike another such deal.

   Therefore, Shi anticipates that as Trump "has repeatedly stated, he
   will exert maximum pressure on China."

Limited resources, abundant distractions

   Shi argues that what may look like opportunities for China are likely
   just distractions, and with its economic growth slowing, China has
   neither the money nor the domestic popular support to try to fill
   leadership roles vacated by the U.S., especially far from home.

   "China must more strictly distinguish which of its foreign interests
   are truly core, and which ones can be reduced or even eliminated," he
   says. "We must reduce China's burden and focus China's strength on
   issues that are truly important to China."

   He adds that China should try to avoid a major conflict with the U.S.
   and its allies. But it should push back where necessary and maintain
   the initiative, rather than always reacting to Washington's actions and
   rhetoric.
